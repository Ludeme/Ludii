/**
 * @chapter Integer functions are ludemes that return a single integer value according to some specified function or criteria. 
 * They specify the {\it amount} of certain aspects of the game state.
 * The value returned by the function can be positive or negative. 
 * 
 * Care must be taken when dealing with negative values, as they are typically used to indicate illegal situations within the code. 
 * Care must also be taken with large positive return values, as they are uncapped and can be arbitrarily large.
