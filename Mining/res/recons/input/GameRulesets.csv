","Boards consist of a grid of 3x4 squares and a continuation of the central row in the grid that extends for 8 further squares. The game is played with two astragals as dice: one from a sheep and one from an ox. The sheep astragal provides the base value for the roll, and the ox astragal serves as a bonus. Rolls of the sheep astragal produce values of 1, 2 ,3 or 4. The ox astragal produces a ""yes"" or ""no"" value. If ""no"" is rolled, the values remain the same. If ""yes"" is rolled, the value of the first roll is boosted to 5, 6, 7, or 10, respectively. These rules are proposed by Finkel based on the values of moves provided in the cuneiform tablets (Finkel 2007: 21–22). Each player starts play on one of the right corners of the 3x4 grid, proceeding left down that row to the opposite corner, and then right down the central track, which both players use, with the goal of moving off the end of the track. If a player lands on a square occupied by the opponent, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and may reenter on a subsequent turn. Rosettes on certain squares in the central track mark spaces where a player is safe from being sent to the beginning. Rosettes in the corners allow a player to roll again when a player lands on them.

Pieces can be frozen, or prevented from moving, when they are adjacent to an opposing stronger piece.","<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arimaa"" target=""_blank"" class=""style1"" style=""color: #0000EE"" />Wikipedia</a>",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"0,5520","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

1) A hand is live if it has at least one finger, and this is indicated by raising at least one finger. If a hand has zero fingers, the hand is dead, and this is indicated by raising zero fingers (i.e. a closed fist).

2) If any hand of any player reaches exactly five fingers, then the hand is dead.

3) Each player begins with one finger raised on each hand. After the first player turns proceed clockwise.

4) On a player's turn, they must either attack or split. There are two types of splits, transfers and divisions.

5) To attack, a player uses one of their live hands to strike an opponent's live hand. The number of fingers on the opponent's struck hand will increase by the number of fingers on the hand used to strike.

6) To transfer, a player strikes their own two hands together, and transfers raised fingers from one hand to the other as desired. However, a player cannot transfer fingers to make a hand have more than 4 fingers.

7) If a player has a dead hand, the player can divide the fingers between the other hand and the dead hand by transferring fingers from the other hand to the dead hand. 

8) A player with two dead hands is eliminated from the game.

9) A player wins once all opponents are eliminated.

A player picks up the contents of any of their holes and sowing them in an anti-clockwise direction, picking up the contents of the last hole in which his counters fall, and continuing sowing. This continues until the last counter falls in an empty hole. Then it is the other player's turn. A hole is captured when the last ball is dropped into an opponent's hole containing three counters, making it four. A player cannot then take from one of these holes that they have captured. Therefore, the player cannot begin a turn from their own captured hole nor can they continue sowing from it if their last counter falls into it. If the last counter of a sowing falls into an opponent's captured hole, one of those counters are removed from the board and placed in the store, and the sowing continues with the contents of any of the player's holes. Ownership of a hole continues even if it becomes empty. When a player cannot move (i.e., there are no counters in their holes except any that are in captured holes), the opponent continues to move until the player is able to move. Play continues until all counters are either placed in the store or in captured holes and thus cannot be moved. Players then count their pieces by placing four in each hole, and the player who has more than their original number takes ownership of one of the opponent's holes for every four counters more than the original number that have been taken. If no player took four more than the original, the player with three extra gets the hole, if each player has two extra they draw lots to see who gets an extra hole. Play then begins again as before.

The fifth hole from the left in the inner row is rectangular, the rest are circular. 64 counters. Play begins with one counter in each hole in the inner row. Players take turns placing their remaining counters on the board in their inner rows.

Point 24: two pieces. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the number on one die and another the number on the other die, or by moving one piece twice (once for each die). Players cannot end their move on a point with multiple opposing pieces. If a player ends the turn on a point with one opposing piece, that piece is placed in the middle of the board (not on a point) and must reenter the board according to the next die roll, counting the origin point as a move of one. They cannot reenter on a point with two or more pieces. No other pieces can move until all of the pieces belonging to that player are removed from the center. When all of a player's pieces are on their final 6 points, they may start removing pieces from the board. They can do so by rolling a 6 to move from the 6th point, and so on down to 1.

Each player has three types of pieces: Circles, triangle, squares, and one pyramid made up of multiple pieces stacked. Circles move one space orthogonally. Triangles move two spaces diagonally. Squares move three spaces orthogonally. Pyramids may move in any of the directions allowed by one of its constituent pieces. Each piece has a number. For white—circles: 2, 4, 6, 8, 4, 16, 36, 64; triangles: 6, 20 , 42, 72, 9, 25, 49, 81; squares: 15, 45, 153, 25, 81, 169, 289; pyramid (91) from the base: square 36, square 25, triangle 16, triangle 9, circle 4, circle 1.

Pieces capture other pieces by mathematical allowances based on the numbers on the pieces. There are nine scenarios in which pieces can be taken when a piece moves to a space occupied by an opponent's piece. 

Multiplication with distance: If the value of the piece to be taken equals the value of the piece making the capture multiplied by the distance between the two pieces; 

Division by distance: If the value of the piece to be taken equals the value of the piece making the capture divided by the distance between the pieces. 

Addition: When two pieces can both move to the space of an opponent's piece, if the sum of the two pieces equals the value of the opponent's piece, it is captured and the player chooses which piece to move to that space. 

Subtraction: When two pieces can both move to the space of an opponent's piece, if the difference between the value of these pieces equals the value of the opponent's piece, it is taken, and the player chooses which piece to move to the space. 

Multiplication: When two pieces can both move to the space of an opponent's piece, if the product of the values of the two pieces equals the value of the opponent's piece, it is taken and the player chooses which piece to move to the space. 

Division: When two pieces can both move to the space of an opponent's piece, if the quotient of the values of the two pieces equals the value of the opponent's piece, it is taken and the player chooses which piece to move to the space.

Encirclement: If pieces are positioned such that there is no possible move or capture for the opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is taken.

Pyramid capture: A pyramid can be captured by capturing its constituent pieces one-by-one according to the above methods; by encircling it so it cannot move, or by obtaining the sum of the constituent pieces or of its base pieces according to the above rules; A pyramid captures as a single one of its component pieces according to the above rules (the direction of the move is independent of the value chosen), or by using the sum of its pieces according to the above rules.

The goal of the game is to capture the opponent's pyramid and to create an alignment on the opponent's half of the board forming a mathematical progression. The progression may be arithmetic (a sequence where the difference between the values is constant), geometric (where each value after the first is determined by multiplying the previous value by a fixed number), or harmonic (1/a, 1/a+d, 1/a+2d, 1/a+3d). The pieces in the progression must be in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line or in a chevron shape, and must be equally spaced.","Stigter 2007: 265-268.","Europe",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"0,5520","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Each player has fifteen pieces, which all begin on the leftmost point on each player's side of the board. Both players move anti-clockwise around the board. Both players roll one die, and the player with the higher number plays first. If it is played after another game, the winner of the previous game goes first. The player rolls two die and begins play with that roll. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the value on one die then another piece the value on the other die, or by moving one piece the value of one die and then the value of the other. When doubles are thrown, they are played twice. If a player can only play one number but not both, they must play the higher number, if possible. To begin, each player may only move one piece, until it passes the opponent's starting point, after which any pieces can be moved. Pieces may only be moved to an empty point or one occupied by another piece belonging to the player. Players may not block all six points in either player's starting quadrant. If a player has blocked six points in a row, and the opponent has moved all of their pieces to the point adjacent to the blocked points, the player must move to unblock one of the points. Once a player has moved all of their pieces into the final six points of their track, they may begin bearing off. They do so by rolling a number equal to the number of points left in the track, plus one. If they cannot bear off, they must make a legal move with a piece that cannot bear off.

Each player starts with fifteen pieces on the starting point of their track. Two six-sided dice. The pieces move around the board in opposite directions in a horseshoe-shaped track.

Each player rolls one die. The player who rolls highest goes first. The player then rolls two die to begin play.  The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves; i.e. a piece must move the full value of an individual die. One piece may move the combined total of the two die. Doubles are played twice. A player must use both numbers of a roll if possible, or all four numbers in the case of doubles. 

If a player lands on a point occupied by a single opposing piece, the opponent’s piece is trapped until the trapping player removes their piece.

A piece may not be moved to a point occupied by two or more of the opponent's pieces. The player cannot move a piece to a point where the opponent has trapped another of the player's pieces. 


Once a player has moved all fifteen of their pieces into the their home section of the board (that is, the six points at the end of the player's track), the player may begin bearing off. A player cannot bear off when the player has one or more pieces trapped inside the their home section. A player bears off by rolling a number equal to the number of points left in the track of a piece, plus one. If there is no piece on the point indicated by the roll, then the player must make a legal move using a piece that will not remove it from the board. If there are no pieces available to fulfill this condition, the player must remove a piece that is furthest from the goal. The first player to bear off all fifteen pieces wins the game.

If the last piece belonging to player remains in the starting position is trapped by the opponent before it has left the starting position, the player loses. The only exception is if the opponent still has pieces on their starting position. A game in which both players' respective pieces in the starting position are trapped is a draw.

In Tavli, in subsequent rounds, the winner of the previous round plays first.

The game is also typically played with a point system, where points are lost based on the winning conditions. Players lose two points by losing if they haven't yet borne off any of their pieces, or one point if they have borne off at least one piece. A player who loses because their final piece in the starting position was trapped loses two points.","<a href=""https://bkgm.com/articles/Mamoun/PlakotoBoardGameStrategy.pdf"" target=""_blank"" class=""style1"" style=""color: #0000EE"" />bkgm.com</a>",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"0,5520","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Each player begins with two pieces on the rightmost point on the opposite side of the board. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the number on one die and other the number on the other die, or by moving one piece the total number of both die. Further pieces are entered based on the roll of the dice, the point after the one with the two pieces on it at the beginning being counted as the first point. When entering captured pieces, however, the point where the two pieces start is counted as the first point. The two pieces which start on the board cannot be moved until all of the remaining pieces have been entered on the board. No more than one piece may rest on a point on the first half of the board, except for the two which start and also on the leftmost point on the opposite side of the board from where the player sits. When a piece lands on a point occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and must be entered again. Players must enter captured pieces before continuing to move the other pieces on the board. When a piece is captured in the opponent's starting quadrant, a point must be left open or with only one piece, thus allowing the opponent to enter their piece.

Once a player has left the starting spot, they move according to the throws, except on throws of 1, which are tabulated for use later. Players continue to throw until they throw 2. Players must land on the last space of the track, I.e. at the center of the spiral, by an exact throw. The player must then roll 1 five times before leaving this space and proceeding back to the starting point. Accumulated rolls of 1 may be used for this. The first player to reach the starting space by an exact throw releases the hyena. The hyena proceeds along the track in the same manner, but moving twice the value of each throw. When the hyena reaches the end of the track, it must throw or pay 1 ten times. The hyena captures any piece it overtakes on the return to the starting space, eliminating that player from the game.","Davies 1925: 145-146.","Sudan",NULL,NULL,NULL,"13°18'3.81""N, 27°42'43.56""E","5425,5425","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

From here, the players move to prescribed spaces based on the throw they make, based on the instructions for the space they are currently on. There are three throws which result in a move: Te (""Influence""; double 4s), Cung (""Pair""; double 2, 3, 5, or 6) or Chang (""Failure""; double 1). The players use the throws as many times as allowed (e.g., six 5s = three Cung, allowing the player to move Cung from each successive square). Throws which do not produce a result where the player can move result in a pass.

Throws of Te generally advance the player along the board. A throw of Te moves the player to the next consecutively numbered space, with the following exceptions:  1-3 to 37; 4-6 to 38; 7 to 73; 8 to 72; 9 to 52; 10 to 51; 11 to 50; 12 to 49; 13 to 48; 14 to 47; 15 to 55; 16-21 to 23; 27 to 56; 30 to 32; 35 to 67; 36 to 66; 46 to 89; 47 to 59; 48 to 74; 49 to 71; 50 to 47; 51 to 50; 52 to 51; 59 to 71; 60 to 62; 61 to 47; 62 to 61; 63 to 65; 64 to 69; 65 to 64; 66 to 60; 67 to 70; 68 to 86; 69 to 84; 70 to 68; 71 to 74; 72 to 90; 73 to 92; 75 to 93; 81 to 31; 82 to 91; 83-88 to the previous consecutively numbered square; 89 to 91; 90 to 92; 91 to 93; 92 to 94; 94 to 97; 95 to 98; 96 to 95.

The store to the right of the player belongs to the player. Play begins with five counters in each regular hole, with one larger stone in each store, but one is slightly smaller than the other. Game can be played with two or four players. With four players, two players control the larger stones, but cannot move the regular counters. Players throw out a finger (index, little, or thumb) to determine who plays first. Index beats thumb, thumb beats little finger, little finger beats index. This happens at the start of each round. Counters are taken from any of the holes in the player's row, sowing them in either direction, including the stores. When the last counter of a sowing is dropped in a hole, sowing continues by picking up the counters in the next hole and continuing to sow in that direction. If the hole following the last seed of a sowing is empty, the counters in the hole following this empty hole are captured. If there is an empty hole following the captured hole, and then an occupied hole immediately after it, the counters in the occupied hole are also captured, and so forth until there are two occupied or two empty holes in a row. Moves may not begin from stores. Both stores are sown into normally by both players. Stores are considered to be empty, except when its large stone remains in it, then the large stone only can be sown or captured and not any other counters that may have accumulated there. Large stones can be sown in any order a player chooses during a sowing. If a player has no counters in their holes, they may opt to place one counter in each of their holes, taking counters from their store and continue play (called huelshe). If they opt not to, the opponent takes all the remaining stones on the board. If one of the large stones remains in its original store, the player cannot opt out. If the player doesn't have enough stones for all of the holes, they may choose which holes in their row to place the counters, but they must form a continuous sequence of holes with counters. When the round ends, players must buy back their large stones if they no longer have them, at a price determined in the beginning of the game (usually seven for the larger stone and six for the smaller). Players then attempt to refill their holes with the original number of counters. The player that has fewer than the original number of counters must borrow counters from the opponent. Debt accumulates over subsequent rounds. When the debt reaches five, the player must sell one of their holes to the opponent. The selling player can choose which holes to sell. The seller then receives five counters to either repay debt or fill holes as long as debt does not exceed four.

Play continues as before, but when the final counter falls into a puta or naga hole, the contents of the opposite hole in the other row are captured.

When one player has fewer than twelve counters at the beginning of a round, they may arrange them differently at the beginning. They may put one or two counters in one end hole and not more than four in the other end hole, and one or two counters in the intermediate holes, leaving some empty and, thus, excluded. The opponent then puts four counters in each of their holes. There are no puta, naga, or wala holes in this round. The player with more counters plays as before, but the one with less has captures that are determined by the number of counters placed in the first end hole. If there were two in the end hole, the player captures when dropping the final counter into a hole to make it three; or when it makes two if there was one counter in the first end hole. Otherwise, the player does not sow in holes with one or two counters.

If sowing fails to reach a hole in the opponent's row, the player makes a second move from a loaded hole in the opposite direction, continuing to do so until they can sow in the opponent's row. If the last counter is sown in a loaded hole, the contents are lifted and sowing continues in the opposite direction. Play continues like this until the last counter lands in an empty hole. If the empty hole is in the opponent's row, play ends. If it lands in an empty hole in the player's row, the counters in the opponent's hole opposite it are placed in the store. If the next hole in the direction of sowing in the player's row is empty, the counters in the opponent's hole opposite that hole are also placed in the store. Single counters cannot be sown. Play continues until both players have only single counters in holes or all of the counters have been captured. These are then collected and placed in the store. If each player has the same number of counters, the game is a draw. If the number of counters is unequal, the player with fewer counters arranges them in their row however they wish. The opponent then matches this arrangement, placing any extras in the store. If the player has fewer than half of the original number of counters, the board is decreased in size by one hole. If less than a quarter, it is decreased by two holes, and if less than one eight, decreased by three holes. If in subsequent rounds a player regains more than one half/one quarter/one eighth of the original total, the board size is increased appropriately.

Further captures in the sowing can occur in the same way. If a player can make a capture on the first sowing they must. Otherwise, they can choose any hole on their side to sow. However, each player has four holes from which clockwise plays can be made: the leftmost two holes in both the inner and outer rows. Clockwise moves can only be made from these holes if they immediately lead to a capture.

Instead, it waits there, immune to capture, until a situation arises where two of the opponent's pieces could theoretically be taken by a pawn. The Baidaq al-Bayadiq is then moved to that spot, any piece (including the player's own) being moved from that spot, and then the capture being made on the next turn.

During the first phase of the game, the players race each other (i.e., do not take turns) to be the first person to drop the last counter into an empty hole. Play moves from left to right in the row closest to the player, right to left in the central row, and left to right in the furthest row. Upon reaching the final hole in the opponent's row, play continues with the first hole in the player's own row. In the first phase, Players take counters from the leftmost hole in their row and sow them in the appropriate direction. When the final counter lands in a hole with counters, they are picked up and sowing continues until the last counter is dropped into an empty hole. Play continues in phase two in the same manner as before, but the players take turns and the player who ""won"" the first phase plays first. Players capture counters when placing the last counter of a sowing into one of their own holes which is empty. If the hole is on the left half of the board, any counters in the two holes of the opponent facing it are captured. If the last hole is on the right half of the board, any counters in the opponent's one hole facing it are captured. The player then continues to move using the last counter placed which effected the capture, and placing it in the next hole. This move can result in further captures (if the hole is empty), continuation of sowing (if there are counters in it), or the end of the turn (if hole is empty and there are no opponent's counters to be captured). Play continues until a player has no counters in their holes. The opponent then captures the remaining counters. Players then redistribute their counters, three in each hole, starting from the leftmost hole in their row in the direction of play. The player with fewer counters distributes all of their counters on the board, even if they cannot place three in the final hole of the counting. The player with more counters then places three counters in the same number of holes as the other player, taking any remaining as their winnings. Play continues in this fashion until one player captures all of the counters.

Either the Adowa or Aksum rules can be played with three players.","Three players. One player controls a full row of six holes, which must be one of the outer rows, and the other two players each own two rows of three on the rest of the board. Play begins with three counters per hole. Sowing occurs in the following direction: from left to right in the outer row owned (or partly owned) by the player row, right to left in the player's half of the central row, proceeding to the opponent's outer row and sowing right to left, then left to right in the other opponent's part of the central row, then proceeding back to the outer row where the player began and proceeding as before. Sowing always begins from a player's own holes. When the last counter falls into an empty hole, the turn ends. If the last counter falls into an occupied hole, the contents of that hole are picked up and sowing continues. A hole is captured by dropping the last counter of a sowing into an opponent's hole which contains three counters, making it have four counters, and becomes a wegue. Captures cannot be made until after the original three counters placed in the holes at the beginning of the game have been moved. Once a wegue is created, the player cannot sow from it. When the final counter of a sowing lands in a wegue owned by the opponent, the player captures two counters from it. Play continues until all of the counters are captured or all of the counters are accumulated in wegue. A new round begins. Players then collect the counters in their captured holes. They count their takings by filling their holes with three counters each as in the beginning, and the player would own every hole they could fill with three counters. If the player has two counters remaining, they also gain another hole and the opponent surrenders their extra counter. At the end of play, if a player captures the opponent's single remaining hole as a wegue, the player captured three counters from it, leaving one for the opponent to continue to play. Play continues until one player cannot fill any holes.

Three counters per hole. Each player owns the row of holes closest to them, as well as the right half of the central row, with respect to their perspective. Sowing occurs from left to right in the player's complete row, right to left in the player's half of the central row, then continuing from right to left in the opponent's outer row, left to right in the opponent's holes in the central row, and then continuing as before into the player's outer row. In the opening phase, players play simultaneously. When the final counter of a sowing falls into an occupied hole, the contents are picked up and sowing continues. Each player plays until their final counter falls into an empty hole; the first player to do so begins the main phase. In the main phase, players alternate turns, and picking up the counters and continuing to sow when the final counter lands in an occupied hole, and stopping when the final counter lands in an empty hole. There are some restrictions with regard to sowing. Each of the player's three leftmost holes cannot be sown from to begin a turn if they contain three counters or less, unless there are no other options for play, in which case sowing must occur from a hole with one counter, and if none are available, then it must begin from a hole with two counters, or three counters if that is the only option. Separately, if the player's other holes only contain two or three counters, the player must play from a hole containing two counters, and these must be the option closest to the opponent's holes. Players must also play from holes containing more than three counters when available. During sowing, a player may not drop a counter into any of the opponent's holes which contain three counters (except when making a nedf, see below), skipping over them and sowing in the next available holes.  When the final counter of a sowing lands in a hole in the opponent's row containing three counters, this hole becomes a ""nedf."" Any counters falling into the nedf cannot be sown. Only one nedf can exist at one time. After the first nedf is made, any others can only be made by placing the final two counters of a sowing into holes which contain three counters, the penultimate hole becoming the new nedf. The player then continues their turn with the counters from the final hole. The hole after the nedf becomes the yazab tabaqi, or ""guardian."" While the yazab tabaqi contains exactly three counters, the opponent cannot create a new nedf. Play continues until one player has no counters to move, or concedes they can no longer make a nedf.","Pankhurst 1971: 165-166.","Horn of Africa",NULL,NULL,NULL,"8°58'34.27""N, 38°45'29.98""E","5471,5471","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

When the final counter falls into an occupied hole, the contents of this hole are picked up and sowing continues. When the final counter lands into an empty hole in the row belonging to the player, the counters in the opposite hole belonging to the opponent are captured, and the counter that triggered the capture is moved to the following hole. This could trigger the further capture of more of the opponent's counters if the hole in which the counter is placed was empty and the opponent's opposite hole contains counters. If the hole is occupied, sowing continues. If the hole is empty and the opposite hole is unoccupied or it is one of the opponent's holes, sowing ends. When one player can no longer play because the holes on their side are empty, the opponent captures the remaining counters on the board. A new round begins. The losing player places three counters in each hole, beginning on the rightmost hole. If the player has remaining counters but cannot fill their holes with three, they must distribute the remainder to fill as many of the remaining holes as possible with at least one counter.

A player picks up the contents of any of their holes and sowing them in an anti-clockwise direction, picking up the contents of the last hole in which his counters fall, and continuing sowing. This continues until the last counter falls in an empty hole. Then it is the other player's turn. A hole is captured when the last ball is dropped into an opponent's hole containing three counters, making it four. A player cannot then take from one of these holes that they have captured. Therefore, the player cannot begin a turn from their own captured hole nor can they continue sowing from it. If the last counter of a sowing falls into an opponent's captured hole, nothing happens on the first instance, but every time after that, one of those counters are removed from the board and placed in the store, and the sowing continues with the contents of any of the player's holes. Ownership of a hole continues even if it becomes empty. When a player cannot move (i.e., there are no counters in their holes except any that are in captured holes), the opponent continues to move until the player is able to move. Play continues until all counters are either placed in the store or in captured holes and thus cannot be moved. Players then count their pieces by placing four in each hole, and the player who has more than their original number takes ownership of one of the opponent's holes for every four counters more than the original number that have been taken.

The original counter is sown into the next hole in the opponent's row, making four, thus creating a tuz, which behaves as explained below. Alternatively, the player may rearrange the counters in a similar manner, but creating an alternating pattern of holes with three and five counters, and not creating a tuz. After this, players pick up the counters in any of the holes in their row and sow them in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter falls into a hole that is occupied, the player picks up the contents of this hole and continues to sow. When the last counter falls into an empty hole, the play ends. Capturing occurs when the last counter falls into a hole on the opponent's side of the board containing three counters, increasing it to four. This hole, a tuz, then belongs to the player who captured it. A player cannot pick up counters from this hole, and the opponent can only do so if the last counter of their sowing falls in the tuz, in which case the opponent takes one counter from it, along with the final counter.

Starting position: in the inner row, the first four holes, number of counters from the right: 0; 2; 2; 6. Play begins with each player alternately introducing the remaining counters in their holes. Each is introduced in such a way as to capture an opponent's counters, by placing it into an occupied hole which is opposite one of the opponent's occupied inner-row holes. The opponent's counters are then captured and sown along the inner row from either the leftmost or rightmost hole. If the capture occurs in the rightmost or leftmost holes in the inner row, or the hole immediately adjacent to them in the inner row, the counters must be sown from the leftmost or rightmost hole (whichever is closest), and sown along the inner row. Captures on these subsequent sowings happen according to the same rules as in the second phase, with certain exceptions explained below. If no capture is available, a counter may be placed in any occupied hole in the inner hole except the square hole, and sows them in either direction. If the square hole is the only occupied hole in the inner row, the counter is placed there and the player sows only two seeds from it in either direction. If a loaded square hole is reduced to six counters, the player places a counter there and sows the entire contents, forfeiting the special status for this hole for the rest of the game. Moves that start without a capture on the first sowing which end in the square hole stops there without further sowing. Sowing cannot start from a square hole except to capture, except as described above. If a sowing from an initial capturing move ends in an occupied square hole and no capture is possible, the player may choose to stop there or continue to sow. Once the contents of this hole have been relayed or captured the square hole loses its special status and the player may not introduce a counter into hole with one counter if there are other holes in the inner row containing multiple counters. Once all of the counters are introduced, second phase starts. Players move by sowing seeds from a player's holes.

Then, each player sows counters in an anti-clockwise direction beginning from the rightmost hole in the inner row, proceeding, picking up the contents of holes when the last counter falls into an occupied hole and continuing sowing. However, the final counter that would fall into the rightmost hole in the outer row (which should now contain 17 counters) is not placed there, but rather on the second to right hole in the inner row, which should now contain one counter. Initial phase: In the initial phase, the rightmost hole in the inner and outer row for each player are out of play. All sowing and capturing only occurs on the remaining holes. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter of a sowing lands in an empty hole, the turn ends. When it falls into an occupied hole in the player's inner row the contents of the opponent's opposite holes in the inner and outer row are captured. These are then sown in the player's holes beginning with the hole from where the previous sowing began. If the final counter of a sowing falls into an occupied hole that cannot make a capture, then the counters in this hole are picked up and sowing continues.

Twenty pieces per player, arrayed on the dark-colored spaces. The square in the left-hand corner closest to the player is a dark square. Pieces move one space forward diagonally. When a piece arrives at the furthest rank opposite their starting position, it becomes a king. Kings may move diagonally, forward or backward, any number of spaces (like a bishop in Chess). Captures are made by hopping over an adjacent piece in a diagonal or orthogonal direction, including backwards. Multiple captures are allowed, in which the player may change direction. Kings capture by flying leap. Captures are mandatory, and the maximum capture should be made based on the value of pieces. Kings are worth less than twice the number of regular pieces, but more than twice the number of pieces minus one. (e.g., three kings are worth less than six pieces, but more than five pieces). If more than one maximum capture has the same value, the one that captures more kings takes precedence. It is permitted to use the same space more than once, but not to hop over the same piece twice. Captured pieces are removed after the turn is complete. The maximum capture can be enforced when the opponent catches it, though the opponent may opt not to point it out. A king cannot make three non-capturing moves in a row without moving another king or piece. This rule does not apply if the player only has one king remaining. If one player has only two kings remaining and the opponent has only one king remaining, the player with two kings must win in seven turns. If they do not, the game is a draw. If both players have only one king remaining and neither of them is able to capture or will be forced into a position where their king will be captured on the next turn, the game is a draw.

Each player has 15 pieces. The starting position is as such, numbering the points from the origin of each player's track: Point six: five pieces. Point 8: three pieces. Point 13: five pieces. Point 24: two pieces. Play begins by each player rolling one die; the player who rolls the highest plays first, and then rolls again to begin play. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the number on one die and another the number on the other die, or by moving one piece twice (once for each die). If doubles are rolled, the player must play the number on each die twice. Players cannot end their move on a point with multiple opposing pieces. If a player ends the turn on a point with one opposing piece, that piece is placed in the middle of the board (not on a point) and must reenter the board according the the next die roll, counting the origin point as a move of one. They cannot reenter on a point with two or more pieces. No other pieces can move until all of the pieces belonging to that player are removed from the center. When all of a player's pieces are on their final 6 points, they may start removing pieces from the board. They can do so by rolling a 6 to move from the 6th point, and so on down to 1. Players must use all available moves presented by the dice. The first player to remove all of their pieces wins. The winner gains one point, or two points if the opponent has pieces in their starting quadrant.

If a piece lands on the same spot occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is sent back to the start. Two pieces moving as a single pawn can only be sent to start by two other pieces moving as a single pawn. Pieces on a marked space cannot be sent to start. A play which sends an opponent's piece to start allows another roll. A player may bypass the central row and circuit the board another time if they wish (i.e., in order to send another player back to start to prevent them from winning). The first player to remove all their pieces from the board wins, and the other platers continue playing until all but one player have moved their pieces into the centre.","Vasantha 2006: 34-37","Mysore",NULL,NULL,NULL,"12°17'44.92""N, 76°38'21.77""E","5358,5358","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

A player picks up the contents of any of their holes and sowing them in an anti-clockwise direction, picking up the contents of the last hole in which his counters fall, and continuing sowing. This continues until the last counter falls in an empty hole. Then it is the other player's turn. A hole is captured when the last ball is dropped into an opponent's hole containing three counters, making it four. A player cannot then take from one of these holes that they have captured. Therefore, the player cannot begin a turn from their own captured hole nor can they continue sowing from it. If the last counter of a sowing falls into an opponent's captured hole, nothing happens on the first instance, but every time after that, one of those counters are removed from the board and placed in the store, and the sowing ends. Ownership of a hole continues even if it becomes empty. When a player cannot move (i.e., there are no counters in their holes except any that are in captured holes), the opponent continues to move until the player is able to move. Play continues until all counters are either placed in the store or in captured holes and thus cannot be moved. Players then count their pieces by placing four in each hole, and the player who has more than their original number takes ownership of one of the opponent's holes for every four counters more than the original number that have been taken.

The first player turns up a piece to begin the game. The color of that first uncovered piece is the color he or she will play in the game. The second player then makes a move, and the two alternate until the game is finished.

There are three kinds of moves. A player may turn a piece face-up, move a piece, or capture an enemy piece. In some game variants, multiple captures may be made in one turn.

Turning a piece face-up is a legal move if there are any face-down pieces on the board. Once revealed, a piece may move, capture, or be captured. 

A player may only move face-up pieces of their own color.

Unlike Xiangqi, all pieces move identically: a piece may move only one square up, down, left, or right. A piece may never move onto a square that is already occupied unless such a move is a legal capture.

A player may only capture with a face-up piece of their own color, and may only capture a face-up piece of the opposing color. In all captures, the captured piece is removed from the board and its square is occupied by the capturing piece.

The pieces are ranked, forming a hierarchy with the general at the top and soldiers at the bottom. Only pieces of equal or lower rank may be captured, with one exception. For instance, a chariot may capture a horse, and the general may capture either, but a horse cannot capture a chariot, and neither can capture the general. The one exception concerns generals and soldiers: the general cannot capture soldiers, and soldiers can capture the general.

In the Hong Kong version, the pieces are ranked in this order: General>Chariot>Horse>Cannon, Advisor>Minster>Soldier. This ranking reflects the approximate value of the corresponding pieces in Xiangqi (though the relative rank of horse and cannon is arguable). All pieces capture exactly as they move: one square up, down, left, or right.

The game ends when a player cannot move, and that player is the loser. Most often, the game is lost because all of a player's pieces have been captured and so he has no pieces to move.

There is no promotion zone in Kyoto shogi. Every time a piece makes a move it alternately promotes and reverts to its unpromoted state. Promotion is effected by turning the piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its promoted rank; demotion is effected by turning the piece back.

The promotion rules and values are reminiscent of microshogi and entirely different from standard shogi: A king cannot promote. A tokin promotes to a lance and vice versa. A silver general promotes to a bishop and vice versa. A gold general promotes to a knight and vice versa. A pawn promotes to a rook and vice versa.

A piece is allowed to move, capture or be dropped in a manner that will prevent it from moving on a subsequent turn, which is illegal in standard shogi. For example, a rook can move onto the farthest rank, becoming a pawn and unable to move further. Such pieces may be captured as any other.

A captured piece may be dropped with either side facing up. There are no restrictions on where pieces can be dropped, other than that the square must be empty. So unlike in regular Shogi, pieces can be dropped in places where they can never move again, pawns can be dropped in files that already contain a pawn, and checkmate can be delivered through a pawn drop.

There are four throwing sticks, three are blank on one side and marked on the other, one stick, the sahe, is marked distinctively on two sides, marked with a green line on the flat side, while the others are marked red.

Throws of 6 or 10 give the player another throw, as do throws of 1 and 3 if the sahe's marked side is up. All of the players on team throw before the players of the other team throw. Play begins from the middle of the river on one side. Each team moves in an opposite direction around the board.

"851","723","Default",NULL,NULL,"1",NULL,"Goal: 
You try to both reduce the number of your own groups as much as possible, and also to block your opponent's ability to reduce his groups down to fewer than yours. Whoever decides to end the game must fill the empty spaces with opponent's pieces, and only then, wins by having equal or fewer groups.
            
Play:
Starting with the board empty, player's take turns placing a piece of their color on an empty position that does not abut any friendly piece. If it is impossible to place a piece, the player, instead, moves a piece to the first empty position in any direction. But whenever a new opportunity for placement is available, the turn must be used for placement.
            
Ending the Game:
            
The game ends at the choice of the player about to move, but only at the beginning of a turn in which there is no forced placement. 
            
Before scoring, the empty spaces are filled with the opponent's pieces. The player who ended the game wins unless the opponent has fewer groups. Because the empty spaces are filled with opponent's pieces, a player who ends the game too soon will lose. On the other hand, since ties go to the player who ends the game, it is important to end the game as soon as you can actually win.

Capture and Pawn Promotion:
  * When pieces other than Kings and Pawns are captured, they are set aside for later Pawn promotion. When a Pawn reaches the side of the board opposite its starting side, it is eligible for promotion.
  * When a Pawn is eligible for promotion, and there are pieces of that colour available from previous capture, then the Pawn is promoted to one of the captured pieces, as the player chooses.
  * If there are no pieces of the given colour when a Pawn reaches the far side, then the Pawn remains where it is (unless captured) until a piece of the given colour is captured. Then, on the player's next turn, the Pawn is promoted.

Piece Movement:
  * Rooks move as in Glinski Chess.
      - They slide in any of the 6 adjacent direction.
  * There are no Bishops in Wellisch Chess.
  * Kings can move one space in any of the six adjacent directions from their current space---West, East, or 60 degrees off either of those. They castle by swapping locations with one of the Rooks belonging to the same player. Castling can only take place when neither the King nor the Rook being moved have moved before.
  * Knights move one space 'diagonally' (i.e., along an edge, to any of the six nearest spaces of the same colour). Note that a Knight always moves to a space of the same colour as the space it moved from.
  * Queens can make any move that would be available to a Rook or a Knight on the current space.
  * Pawns can advance with or without capturing by moving one space forward to an adjacent space slightly left or right of forward. Pawns can never advance more than one space. There is no en passant capture. As mentioned above, Pawns can be promoted upon reaching the side of the board farthest from their starting side, but can only be promoted to a piece (Queen, Rook, or Knight) of the same colour that has already been captured. If a Pawn reaches the farthest side without any captured pieces available, then it remains in that position until a piece becomes available for its delayed promotion, on the player's next turn. (Note: Currently, on a turn where the delayed promotion takes place, the possible post-promotion movement of the Pawn is displayed before the promotion visually takes place.)

The game ends when a King is captured, or there is a stalemate due to turns elapsed without a capture or Pawn move.
  * When the game ends in checkmate, the checkmating player wins, the checkmated player loses, and the remaining player draws.
  * When the game ends in stalemate, all players draw. (Note: A player not being able to escape check passes the current move, This does not result in a stalemate.)

Variations: In Wellisch's version of the game, the first player to capture another's King takes possession of the other player's pieces. (The Pawns keep their direction of movement.) In another variant, some people play with a rule that if Player 1's move exposes a threat by Player 2 against Player 3's King, then Player 2 may not capture Player 3's King until Player 3 has had a chance to move.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"0,5520","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Players begin in opposite arms of the cross that do not contain the bange. Pieces enter the board on the top square of the central row of their arm, proceed down that row, then continue in an anti-clockwise direction around the board, until returning to the central track in the player's arm and proceeding toward the central square of the board. The player moves the pieces according to the throws. A piece must move the full value of a single throw, unless one of the throws allows the entering of a piece. When a piece lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and must re-enter from the beginning. Pieces resting on squares marked with X cannot be sent back to start in this way. Two opposing pieces cannot occupy the same safe space, but two pieces belonging to the same player may. Pieces entering the central row of the player's arm are placed on their side to indicate they are moving toward the goal, rather than just starting. Pieces enter the central space (the kitchen) by throwing a dust or bange from the final space in the central row. When this is thrown, and the player has other pieces on the board, the piece waiting to enter the kitchen uses the point normally used to enter pieces to exit, and the remaining value of the throw can be used by other pieces.

Pieces begin on the board, with one each in the sixth and seventh space of the central row of the player's arm, (counting from the top of the row), and in the seventh and eighth spaces of the left row of the arm belonging to the player to the right. The latter two pieces must move as a pair, I.e., they must always be moved together, and can only do so when doubles are thrown. The other two pieces belonging to a player may move singly. Throws may be split up as a player sees fit, but the value of one die must be used it its entirety by a piece. Pieces move around the board in an anti-clockwise direction until they reach their central row, at which point they move up the central row to the central spot. They must enter the central space by an exact throw. When a player moves all of their pieces to the center, they continue to throw the dice, and use these throws to move their partner's pieces. When all of the team's pieces reach the center, that team wins.","Humphries 1906: 119-121.","India",NULL,NULL,NULL,"25°12'35.98""N, 80°55'11.08""E","5404,5405","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Four throwing sticks, marked on one side and blank on the other, used as dice. The values of the throws are equal to the number of blank sides up, when no blank sides are up the throw = 5. Throws of 1, 4, and 5 grant the player another throw. All throws are made before moving, and a piece must move the full value of one throw at a time. Players alternate turns throwing the sticks, and the first one to throw 1 plays as white and moves the white piece in front. When a piece lands on a space occupied by the opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is sent back to the space where the piece that captured it moved from. When a player has two or more pieces in consecutive spaces, these pieces cannot be sent backward in this way. If a player cannot use a throw to move a piece forward, it must be used to move a piece backward. If a backward move makes a player's piece land on a space occupied by a piece belonging to the opponent, the opponent's piece is sent to the place where the player's move began. If a player cannot move, the turn ends. Spaces 26-30 provide special rules allowing the player to bear off. To move beyond square 26, the player must first land on it with an exact throw. From there, the player may: bear off with a throw of 5; move to square 30 with a throw of 4 and bear off on any subsequent throw; move to square 29 with a throw of 3, but it must stay there until borne off with a throw of 2; move to square 28 with a throw of 2, but it must stay there until borne off with a throw of 3. Pieces in squares 28 and 29 are never required to move backward and bearing off is not required from any space. When a player lands on squares 28-30 and an opponent's piece is already there, the opponent's piece is sent to square 27 instead of 26. When a piece is in square 27, whether by being sent there as described above or by being forced to use a throw of 1 to move into square 27, the player may either move the piece back to square 15 and lose one turn, or may leave the piece in square 27 until a 4 is thrown, bearing the piece off. A player cannot move any other piece on the board when one remains in square 27 or 15 after being sent back to it, and pieces which normally would be protected from bring sent back because they are next to each other may now be sent back. Pieces in squares 28-30 are safe as long as a piece is in square 27. The player in square 27 may decide to give up trying to throw a 4 on any turn and move this piece back to square 15 and lose their next turn.

Four sticks, with one flat and one round side, used as dice. The value of the throw is equal to the number of flat sides up; when all round sides are up the throw = 5. A throw of 5 grants the player another throw. Players may enter a piece onto the board with a throw of 1. When a piece is entered, another throw is granted which must be used to move that piece. Throws may be divided among the pieces on the board as a player sees fit. Splitting throws in this way cannot be used to enter a piece, but the throw which is granted to move an entered piece may be divided, as long as the entered pieces moves at least one space. Pieces cannot land on the same space. If a throw does not allow a piece to move forward, it must move backward. All pieces must move in the same direction during a turn. If it is impossible for a piece to move from square 1, it must be removed from the board and entered again. If a player cannot move forward or backward, the turn ends. Squares 15 and 26 grant the player an extra throw. If pieces land on these squares as a result of splitting a throw, that throw must be fully used before the new throw is taken. A piece which lands on square 27 is removed from the board and must enter again. Players must bear off the board by an exact throw. Pieces may not move backwards from squares 28, 29, or 30. Pieces are not required to bear off unless no other forward move is possible.

Pieces begin on the board on the first row of spaces, alternating white and then black. Four sticks used as dice, with one red side and one plain side. Throws are determined by the number of plain sides that land face up, when all red sides are up the throw = 6. Throws of 1, 4, and 6 grant the player another throw. Throws are played immediately after they are thrown. The first player to throw a 1 plays as black, moves the black piece in front of the line of pieces one space, and then continues to play. Pieces which are in their starting spots may not move until after the piece immediately in front of them has moved. Pieces may not move past a group of the opponent's pieces which are resting in three squares in a row. Pieces may land on a square with an opponent's piece, sending the opponent's piece back to the unoccupied space furthest from the end. However, if two or more of the opponent's pieces are in a row, these cannot be sent back in this way. Pieces on squares 26, 28, 29, and 20 are likewise safe from being sent back. If a piece cannot move forward, it must move backward to an open space. If no moves are possible, the turn ends. A piece landing in square 27 is sent back to the furthest unoccupied space from the end. Pieces cannot be borne off until all of the player's pieces are in the last row. Pieces moving beyond the final space are borne off the board. The first player to remove their pieces from the board wins.

The first player takes the counters from the holes in each of the row of holes closest to them, and places them in the central row of their holes in the further row. The counters from the hole next in the direction of sowing are then sown. The counters from the central hole in the further of the player's rows are then sown. When this is completed, the player takes the counters from the holes in the row closest to them, and holds them until the opponent performs the same sequence of moves on their side of the board. At this point, each player places the counters they are holding into any hole on the opponent's side of the board which contains more than one counter. Players then alternate turns sowing pieces around their holes of the board. Sowing always skips the hole from which sowing began. When the final counter of a sowing causes a hole to contain four counters, these counters are placed on any hole on the opponent's side of the board that contains more than one counter. When a player has only single seeds in their holes, and the opponent is about to place counters in the player's holes, the opponent moves one of the player's counters into another hole containing one counter, thus making two, and places the counters from the opponent's side are placed there. The player who is able to place all of their counters on the opponent's side of the board wins.","Herskovits 1932: 27-28.","Suriname",NULL,NULL,NULL,"5°4'48""N, 54°51'27.64""W","5430,5430","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The values of the throws are equal to the number of white sides up, except when no white sides are up the throw equals 8. Throws of 1, 4, and 8 grant the player another throw. Players make all of the throws in their turn first, and then move the values of the throws individually. A player cannot subdivide the value of a single throw between pieces, but may move more than one piece in a turn if they have multiple throws, moving a piece the value of an entire throw. Pieces may only enter the board with a throw of 1. When a player has no pieces on the board, throws made before a throw of 1 do not count and cannot be played. Pieces enter on the marked square on the outer track of the square in front of the player. Pieces move anticlockwise around the outer squares of the board until they reach the square just before the square from which they started, then moving to the inner track and moving clockwise, and then onto the central square. Multiple pieces may occupy the same square. If a player's piece lands on a spot occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and must be entered again. If the opponent has multiple pieces on this spot, they all are sent to the beginning. Sending an opponent's piece off the board grants the player another throw. Pieces on marked squares cannot be sent off the board. If a player has two pieces on the marked square on the opposite side of the board from the one in which they begin, the player may declare these as a twin which then play as one piece. Twins move half the value of a throw, rounding down. Twins may only be sent off the board by another twin. Twins may not send back to start a single piece belonging to an opponent. When sent off the board, the twins enter the board again as single pieces. When the twin reaches the central space, it becomes two single pieces again. When all of a player's pieces are in the central square, they may begin bearing them off. A throw of 1 is required to bear a piece off. The player who bears off all their pieces first wins.","Bell 1960: 17-20.","India",NULL,NULL,NULL,"14°39'3.09""N, 75°14'35.14""E","5456,5456","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

-- Discs that move using steps and/or hops with flip-captures, Discs score according to the value selected in the (Options) normally -10.
Note: look in the drop-down (Options) tab to see what Option are selected. 

Equi gets its name from the Hex placement rules: The neighbourhood of the chosen location for a Hex must contain equal numbers of your own and your opponent's pieces.  This neighbourhood could be defined either as adjacent locations, or as locations in each direction of travel that are at the same distance as the closest relevant piece. (See the (Options) for your game.) The (Options) also determine who you can hop and who is your enemy in a multi-player setting.
            
Turns: Each turn offers a choice, either place any a piece, or move a Disc. 
In addition, the Disc move may be followed by optionally placing a Hex.
Any placement ends the turn.

The standard options make Disc 'flip-captures' mandatory: This means that if a Disc is next to an opponent's piece which it can hop, then it must do so. The ownership of the hopped piece flips immediately. 

The same Disc may hop any number of available pieces, but may not, in any case, hop over the same location twice in the same turn. 

Depending on the (Options) chosen the Disc may, or may not, hop friendly pieces. Hopping friendly pieces is never required.

In some (Options) the hopped pieces also 'morph' between Disc and Hex. The (Options) also determine whose pieces morph and whose don't.

Except for Enemy flip-captures, all parts of a turn are optional and passing is allowed. But be careful about not making a placement during a turn, as this is an offer to end the game.

Placements:
Sites for placing Hexes have already been explained.
Sites for placing a Disc at the beginning of a turn, are given in the (Options). 
-- 'Non-Hex' means sites where Hexes are not allowed to be placed.
-- 'Safe' means not on sites where the next player's first action could be to hop-flip the Disc.
-- 'Any' means any empty site

"1170","1012","Yut Nori",NULL,"Rules for Yut Nori.","5","Rules for Yut Nori.","The game is played between two partners or two teams who play in turns, sometimes it is played with more teams. There is no limit in the number of participants in a game, which means that the game can be played by a considerable group. When played with large groups it is not uncommon for some group members never to cast the sticks: they still participate discussing the strategy.

The start of the game is determined by each team casting the yut-sticks. The team with the highest score starts first.

Each team then casts the sticks in turn, then moves a mal according to the score achieved. One turn usually consists of only one cast. However, a player achieving a yut or mo earns an extra cast for the turn; if he/she casts a yut or mo at the second cast, he/she earns an extra cast again, so there is no limit to the number of times a player can cast again before the end of a turn, provided he or she keeps casting yuts or mos. The respective scores can be played separately if wished, each given to another mal (or group of mals, see below), but a score earned from one cast cannot be split into two moves—for example, a geol (advance three steps) cannot be split into a do (one step) and a gae (two steps).


The four possible courses of the game of Yut
As long as there are mals outside the board, a team can either put a new mal onto the board according to the scores it got, or move a mal already on the board. The mals travel around the board and can move forward only. However, when landing on one of the big stations (in the corner and the centre), the team can choose to take the shorter way should they wish to. There are four possible courses, the default course being longest one with no abbreviation (No. 4).

If a mal lands on a station occupied by the opponent's team, the opponent's mal is removed from the course and returned to the starting position, and the current player is allowed to cast again.

If a mal lands on a station occupied by the own team, these mals can form a group and travel together from that point on.  However, this bears a risk: If an opponent lands their mal on a station occupied by a group of mals of the opponent, all mals in the group are removed from the course.

For example, if one casts two yuts and one do at his/her first turn in the game, possible moves would include (see The Stations below for the station names):

Put a mal on the board at the yut station (uses the first yut score); advance to mo (uses the do score), then to sok-yut (uses the second yut).
Put a mal on the board at the yut station (uses first yut score); put another mal on the board at the same yut station (uses the second yut score), causing the two mals to move together from then on; advance them to mo (uses the do).
Put a mal on the board at the yut station (uses the first yut); advance to duet-geol (uses the second yut), then to duet-yut (uses the do).
The game is won by the team who brings all their mals home first, that is complete the course with all their mals. A course is completed if a mal passes the station where the game is started (cham-meoki). Landing on cham-meoki is no finish, but any score going ""beyond"" this station completes a home run. Yut is often played for three or more wins.

(A rhombus is closed off when it is adjacent to no rhombus that can be filled in on a future turn.)

"1185","1027","Default",NULL,NULL,"1",NULL,"Ex nihilo is a game for 2 players played with stackable pieces of two colors on the cells of a hexagonal arrangement of hexagons (a hexhex board). The board starts out empty. The game is over as soon as one player is unable to make a move. The other player is then the winner.

Even though the goal is technically stalemate, out of the interlocking mechanics emerges a territorial goal with a constant threat of a clever check mate turning the tide or ending the game before territory is settled.

The novelty of this game lies in its central gimmick: Every move consists in moving a stack. In this sense it is a pure movement game. Yet, the game features both placement and captures.

Movement – overview:
Stacks move along straight open lines and grow when they move away from the center cell. This game is unusual in allowing movement of stacks containing 0 pieces. It is by growing these that pieces get onto the board in the first place.

Movement – details:
On your turn, you must move a stack not topped by an enemy piece to an empty cell reachable through an unbroken line of empty cells. By convention, a single piece is considered a stack of size 1 and an empty cell is considered to contain a stack of size 0.

If, after you have moved a stack, it is farther away from the center cell than before it was moved (measured in number of steps), its size is increased by 1 per step further away from the center it now is. This happens automatically in Ludii.

You may move a proper part of a stack by splitting it. To move a part of a stack, drag the piece that will be the bottom piece of the new stack to its destination, or click it, then the destination.

You may also move a whole stack, but only on the condition that you move it farther away from the center cell. A consequence is that moving a whole stack always results in its size increasing. Together with the convention that empty cells contain stacks of size 0, this also has the consequence that you can effectively place a new stack on the board by moving a stack of size 0. In Ludii a 0-stack is represented by a grey disc. You move it by dragging it to where you want to go, or click it, then the destination.

Note that nothing special happens to the cell you moved the 0-stack from – it still contains a 0-stack.

Capturing - overview:
Flanked enemy stacks are captured by being taken hostage for a move. Capturing is obligatory: If a capturing move is available, a capturing move must be made.

Capturing - details:
If (and only if) the top piece of a stack is of your color, it is said to partake in flanking an enemy stack if (i) this enemy stack is exactly in the middle of a line of otherwise empty cells going from the flanking stack to another one of your stacks, and (ii) all three of these stacks are of the same size.

If, after you have moved a stack, it partakes in flanking one or more enemy stacks, you must immediately move one of these enemy stacks. Except for the obvious difference that you are moving an enemy stack, all normal rules apply to this move. For example: If the captured stack grows (if you move it farther away from the center cell, that is), it grows by the addition of pieces of your color, so situations where this hostage move must itself be a capturing move are possible. Such chaining of captures must continue until you capture a stack that is not in a position to continue the chain. Growing captured stacks is the only way to take ownership of them more permanently.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"0,5520","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The elephant is carved like a camel or bear, because in the meandering frontiers of the north, there are no elephants. There are many footsoldiers, because there is strength in numbers. There are no scholars, because they are not valued. The pieces are not placed on the lines but on the squares because this would be more secure. The horse always moves sideways for six squares, and the camel sideways for nine. This is because a camel is faster than a horse. Pieces can go all over the board, and there is no river boundary. This is to follow the water and grasses for pastures. The footsoldier moves on square forward each time to the last rank. It captures an enemy piece in front by moving diagonally.

The Suffragettes are colored green, and the large pieces are distinguished as Leaders of the Suffragette Party. The Police Force is colored dark blue, and the large pieces are distinguished as Inspectors of Police. The Suffragettes are placed on the squares marked ‘S’ near ‘Albert Hall.’ The leaders of the party are positioned as follows: One leader is placed in the middle of the front row, and the other four Leaders are placed at the ends of the front and second rows.

One Inspector is placed in the middle of the front row, and the remaining four Inspectors at the ends of the front and second rows.

Each player alternatively moves or hops one of his or her own pieces. Moving can result in moving to one space into a single adjacent square, hopping over your own pieces to move farther along the board, or hopping over an opponent’s piece to 'arrest' or 'disable' your opponent’s piece. A piece may move horizontally or diagonally one square a turn into any of the 8 adjoining squares, but that square must be unoccupied.  Pieces may freely move over any part of the board except:

a.) No piece can be moved (except when arrested or disabled) onto the spaces marked Prison, Prison Yard [PY], Hospital, or Hospital Grounds [HG].

b.) A Suffragette cannot move onto the spaces marked Albert Hall [AH]. 

c.) A Policeman cannot move onto the spaces marked House of Commons [HC].

On a player’s turn, they may hop a piece rather than move it a single square. Hopping means jumping over one of your own pieces into the unoccupied square on the other side of the hopped over piece (as in Checkers). A player may string together hops into multiple jumps, provided that each jump lands in a permitted zone (as listed above) and there is a space in between each piece hopped over. If the square behind a piece is occupied, the hop cannot be completed. Any piece having gained entrance into their opponent’s House of Commons or Albert Hall may move about freely on the squares representing the building, but must not move or hop away from those squares. Moving within either the House of Commons or Albert Hall spends a player’s turn.

Properly hopping over your opponent’s pieces results in arresting or disabling your opponent’s piece(s). Police may arrest Suffragettes and Suffragettes may disable Police through jiu jitsu. Disable is a term used in jiu jitsu when an opponent is neutralized. Any piece standing on one of the squares in The Arena (squares marked pink) is liable to be arrested or disabled by their opponent. Any of your pieces may arrest or disable your opponent’s pieces. A Suffragette disables the Police by hopping over him in a diagonal direction. A Leader of the Suffragette Party can disable any member of the Police Force by hopping over him in any direction. A Policeman arrests a Suffragette by hopping over her in a diagonal direction. An Inspector of Police arrests any Suffragette member by hopping over her in any direction. A piece can only arrest or disable its opponents when it is hopping, not when simply moving. Thus, one of the smaller pieces may hop over a Leader or Inspector simply to move about the board. A single piece may arrest or disable multiple pieces during one series of jumps. Suffragettes who are arrested are moved to the Prison. Police who are disabled are moved to the Hospital. No piece can be arrested or disabled on yellow squares outside the Arena, but may move or hop freely on these squares.

If at any point, the Prison and the Hospital each contain 12 or more inmates, either player may propose a release. The other player accept or reject this. If accepted the proposer moves one of their disabled pieces to the Prison Yard [PY] or Hospital Grounds [HG] as appropriate. Then the other player does the same but the piece chosen must be of the same value as the one the proposer released. The proposer cannot release a major piece if the other player does not have any disabled major pieces. This is repeated until either the Prison Yard and Hospital Grounds are full or the proposer passes. No exchange can be proposed while any piece remains on the Prison Yard or the Hospital Grounds.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"0,5520","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

"1224","1066","Default",NULL,NULL,"1",NULL,"Objective
            Each player tries to achieve a majority of territory.
            Objectively, territory means a player's pieces on a filled board when no captures are left to be made. 
            
            However, as implemented, territory is a score which is based on a reading of each occupied cell and its neighbors to see who would own that cell if the opponent were allowed a neighboring placement and a chance to capture there. 
            Empty cells are scored as a player's territory that player's piece would be safe there, but the opponent's stone would not, even with another stone added to help it.
            
            In general this underestimates objective territory except in the case of chain captures. 
            To prevent ending the game while chain captures are pending, a player must exceed the majority count by 3 to win, unless no moves are left.
            
            Definitions:
            - The vicinity of a site is that site, together with all the sites immediately adjacent to it.
            - The action-potential of a site is the number of the moving player's stones in the site's vicinity minus the number of the opponent's stones there. For example, the action-potential of a site on Black's move is 3 if its vicinity contains either: 5 Black and 2 White, 4 Black and 1 White, or 3 Black and no White.
            
            The structure of the game:
            Before play begins, one player places a Black stone and two White stones on three different sites. 
            Then the other player decides to play either as Black or as White. 
                       
            A standard setup is provided by default. To choose other positions, select the Pie option from the menu.
            
            After the player's colors are determined, player alternate turns with each taking two moves in succession on their turn, beginning with Black.  
            
            Moves:
            A move begins on a site that has sufficient action-potential to be completed (calculated as described above). 
            Before movement, the following amounts are deducted from the action-potential, based on the site's contents:
            
            -- No deduction is taken if the site is already occupied by your own stone.
            -- If the site is occupied by the enemy, you deduct 2 actions to remove and replace it with your stone.
            -- If the site is empty, you deduct one action to add one of your own stones, with the following exception:
            ---- The empty-site deduction is waived if there is no other empty site next to the chosen site and the action-potential at that site is zero.
                        
            When you select a site, the application will calculate these deductions for you, and if there is any remaining action potential, it will be shown on the transparent stone.
            
            You may use this leftover actions potential, to move the stone at that site, in a sequence of steps and jumps; spending one action for each space moved during the sequence.
            -- A step is a move to an adjacent empty site.
            -- A jump is a movement in a straight line over occupied sites.
            The distance along the path traveled may not exceed the number of actions that remain.
            
            The application accepts a click on the final destination of the stone. It calculates whether the destination can be reached according to the rules. If you click on the current site or a site at an intermediate distance, the move will end there.
            
            Voluntary passing and partial passing are allowed.
            
            The following rule to keep the game progressing must be obeyed when ever possible:
            -- A player must add or capture whenever that player has not added a piece within the last 3 moves (i.e. at least once in 2 turns.)
            
            Ending the game:
            The game ends when the two scores add up to the size of the board, or when the score of one player exceeds half the board plus a safety factor of 3. 
            The score is based on:
             1 point for each friendly piece unless: 
             A. It could be captured by the opponent if an opponent's piece were added next to it, or 
             B. It could not be defended against capture by adding a friendly piece after 2 opponent's pieces were added next to it.
             
             1 point for each opponent's piece that can be captured, even if all the rest of the empty sites around it are filled with opponent's pieces
             (this purposely underestimates the territory)
             
             1 point for each empty space where both A: and B: below are true,
             A: if a friendly piece were placed there, it would be secure no matter how many additional opponent's pieces were placed next to it. 
             B: if an opponent's piece were placed there and on an adjacent empty site, one of them could be captured if the remaining sites around them were filled with friendly pieces.

When a player has only one counter on their side of the board, it may capture by moving from the central row directly to the inner row hole above it to make a capture (i.e., without following the normal track), and on the move prior to the capture, from the outer to the central row.

"1270","1113","Default",NULL,NULL,"1",NULL,"Cage is a checkers variant for two players played on a square 10x10 board. In this implementation you also have the option of playing on smaller boards. In the initial position, 50 checkers of one color and 50 checkers of a different color fill up the board in a checkered pattern. The goal of the game is to capture all your opponent's checkers.

On your turn, if you can, you must choose one of two different kinds of moves to perform:
• a single step, or
• a sequence of jumps.
Note: A single jump is considered a jump sequence of length 1.

Universal restriction:
All moves are subject to the following restriction:
• At no time may a checker be orthogonally adjacent to a checker of the same color.

Stepping:
Stepping is moving one of your checkers to an orthogonally or diagonally adjacent empty square, and this kind of move is subject to the following two additional restrictions:
• A step my never bring the number of orthogonal enemy neighbors of the moved checker down to 0.
• The only condition under which a step may fail to bring the moved checker closer to the center of the line you are moving along is if it brings its number of orthogonal enemy neighbors up from 0.

(Some elaboration on this last restriction: In general, a step must decrease the moved checker's straight line distance to the board's central intersection. That's the same as bringing it closer to the center of the orthogonal or diagonal line you are moving along. (Note: The center of a diagonal line is an intersection if it is an even number of squares long, and a square otherwise. The center of an orthogonal line is an edge if it is an even number of squares long, and a square otherwise.) Here is a different way of putting it: Whatever diagonal or orthogonal line you are stepping along, the largest distance to an edge square on this line before the step must be bigger than the largest distance to an edge square on the same line after the step. The only exception to this rule, as explained in the last restriction, is if your checker has no orthogonal neighbors and can step into such a relationship – then you may step in any direction.)

Jumping sequences:
If a checker of your color is orthogonally adjacent to an enemy checker, and immediately on the opposite side of that enemy checker is either an empty square or the outside of the board, your checker may initiate a sequence of jumps. You do this by jumping your checker over to the opposite side of the enemy checker and immediately removing the jumped piece. If your checker lands outside the board, it too is removed from the board. Note: If your last checker is removed when you capture your opponent's last checker, you still win.

If the jumping checker lands in a position where it can jump again, your turn does not end, and the checker must make yet a jump. If there are several ways to continue the sequence, you may choose freely between these. The sequence of jumps only ends when the checker lands on a square where it can make no further jump.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"0,5520","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Castling can happen in three moves, moving the Shah forward or backward once orthogonally and once with the Asb's  move, and moving the Rukh to the Shah's former space. Castling can also be done on the Fers's side, but moving the Rukh to the Fers's space. When a piece moves to a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured. If the Shah can be captured on the opponent's next turn, it is in check. A player's Shah must not be in check at the end of their turn. If this is impossible, it is checkmate and the opponent wins.

The game start on an empty board. Play alternates.
        
On a turn either: 
1. Pass (sometimes this is forced); or 

2. Place a goat on an empty cell that is not too close to another goat of its color: 
-- If they are in line, they need gap of 2 or 3 spaces (as selected in Options.)

3. Move one of your goats one step with the following condition:
-- the goat must gain more contacts with adjacent goats of its own kind than before; or 

4. Use the following alternate condition to step-move a goat that cannot move using the previous rule: 
-- the step must reduce your goat's net contact with enemy goats.  

Exception: Moves using rule 4. are not allowed immediately after the previous player has passed.
        
Capture
-- After moving, simultaneously remove all individual enemy goats that have no adjacent space empty.
-- Capturing does not happen on a passing turn: to capture one must play a piece. 

Ending the game 
-- The game ends with 2 passes. Then the number of connections are compared. 
-- In the case of a tie, the last to pass loses.

 - <i>White</i> (the Persians) has orthodox chess pieces in standard spaces: 2 Rooks (A1, H1); 2 Knights (B1, G1); 2 Bishops (C1, F1); 1 Queen (D1); 1 King (E1); 8 Pawns (A2-H2).
 - <i>Black</i> (the Spartans) has: 2 Lieutenants (A8, H8); 1 General (B8); 1 Warlord (G8); 2 Kings (C8, F8); 2 Captains (D8, E8); 8 Hoplites (A7-H7).
<b>The Moves</b>
 - <i>Pawns</i> can move (but not capture) one space forward. On their first move they can move two spaces forward. They capture one space diagonally forward. There is no en passant rule.
 - <i>Rooks</i> can move and capture any number of spaces orthogonally.
 - <i>Bishops</i> can move and capture any number of spaces diagonally.
 - <i>Knights</i> can move one space orthogonally with one space forward diagonally leaping over intervening pieces and capturing what they land on.
 - The <i>Queen</i> can move and capture any number of spaces orthogonally or diagonally.
 - <i>Kings</i> can move and capture one space orthogonally or diagonally.
 - <i>Lieutenants</i> (shown as crosses) can move and capture diagonally upto two spaces, jumping over any piece if necessary. They can also move (but not capture) one space sideways.
 - The <i>General</i> (shown as an upside-down rook) can move and capture any number of spaces orthogonally or one space diagonally.
 - The <i>Warlord</i> (shown as an upside-down bishop) can move and capture any number of spaces diagonally or like a knight.
 - <i>Captains</i> (shown as squares) can move and capture upto spaces orthogonally and may jump if necessary.
 - <i>Hoplites</i> (shown as an upside-down pawns) can move (but not capture) one space diagonally forward. On their first move they can move two spaces diagonally forward, jumping if necessary. They capture one space forward.
<b>Winning</b>
The Spartan and Persian have different victory conditions.
<i>Spartan Victory</i>: The Spartan wins when the Persian King is checkmated as in orthodox chess.
<i>Persians Victory</i>: The Persian wins once one of the Spartan Kings is captured and the remaining Spartan King is checkmated or when both Spartan Kings are placed under simultaneous attack (duple-check) and neither King can be removed from attack on the next move (Duple-Check and Mate).
<b>First Move</b>
The Persians, being the aggressors historically and White, always move first.
<b>Check Immunity</b>
When the Spartan has two Kings in play a Spartan King is immune from check. Thus, the Spartan may move a King onto an enemy attacked square, leave a King under attack or move a piece that would expose a King to attack.
<b>Duple-Check & Mate</b>
If both Spartan Kings are placed under simultaneous attack this is a form of check called duple-check. It is illegal for the Spartan to make a move that will place both of his Kings underattack. With both Kings under attack, the Spartan loses if on his move he is unable to remove at least one King from attack. In such case the game ends in checkmate.
<b>Promotion</b>
A hoplite, upon reaching its 8th rank, may promote to any Spartan piece including a King but only if the Spartan has only one king in play.
A pawn, upon reaching its 8th rank, may promote to any Persian piece apart from the King.
<b>Capturing en passant</b>
There is no capturing en passant in Spartan Chess.

            <b>Movement Restrictions:</b>
            
            Humans may travel across plains, forests, and shallow water. They may also move 1 space into mountains instead of their regular movement.
            Vehicles may travel across plains. They may also move 1 space into forests or shallow water instead of their regular movement.
            Aircraft may travel across all spaces.
            Boats may travel across shallow and deep water.
            Buildings cannot move (obviously).
            Units cannot move over enemy or neutral occupied spaces.
            
            //------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            <b>Damage Calculation:</b>
            
            An attacking unit deals damage equal to its health, multiplied by its damage factor. 
            For example, A submarine has a damage factor of 80%, so a submarine with 20 health will deal 16 damage when it attacks (20 x 0.8).
            If the defending unit is in shallow or deep water, it takes 25% more damage.
            If the defending unit is in a forest, it takes 25% less damage.
            Aircraft are unaffected by terrain when calculating damage against them.
            All damage values are rounded down to the nearest whole number.
            
            //------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            <b>Fog of War:</b> (Optional)
            
            All friendly units and buildings can see tiles up to 2 spaces away.
            Aircraft can see tiles up to 3 spaces away.
            Boats can see shallow and deep water tiles up to 3 spaces away.
            Humans on a mountain can see tiles up to 3 spaces away.
            Forest and mountain tiles can only be seen if adjacent to them.
            Enemy units and buildings that are not visible cannot be attacked, and have their type and health hidden.

            Hardened Resolve - Units do 50% less damage, but take 50% less damage.
            Preemptive Strike - Units do 50% more damage when attacking, but never deal counter damage.
            Retaliation - Units do 50% less damage when attacking, but deal 100% more counter damage.

A Bidah may move two squares on its first move. Bidahs may capture en passant only when it is blocked from moving forward by another of the opponent's Bidahs; the blocked Bidah has the option in this scenario of capturing with an en passant move, with the option of capturing either of the two Bidahs in question.
The Rajah, for its first move may move like a Kudah as long as it has never been checked. 

Players capture pieces by moving onto a space occupied by an opponent's piece. 

Castling occurs by moving the Rajah to the left or the right two squares, regardless of any intervening pieces; the Tor is not moved as part of this move. 

Promotion of Bidahs occur when they reach the opposite edge of the board, but only immediately if they reach the Tor's square. If it captures on the square next to the Tor's square, from the square in front of the Tor's square, it must move backward diagonally to the square in front of the Tor's square on a subsequent turn and continue before promotion. A Bidah reaching the Kudah's square must move backward diagonally once, to the right or left, before being promoted; a Bidah reaching the Gajah's square must move backward diagonally right or left two spaces, and a Bidah reaching the Raja or Mantri's square must move backward diagonally three squares before being promoted. Bidah's can be promoted to whatever piece the player wishes.

Players alternate turns moving their pieces diagonally one space forward to an empty space. A piece may capture an opponent's piece by hopping over it to an empty space on the opposite side of the opponent's piece, in a forward direction only. When pieces are captured, they are placed underneath the piece making the capture, forming a stack, controlled by the player whose piece is on top, the ""commander."" When a stack is captured, the commander is captured and the capturing piece becomes the commander, thus reducing the stack by one. The piece which is now on top of the stack now becomes the commander of that stack. Stacks always move together and cannot be broken apart. Capturing is compulsory when it is possible. There is no obligation to capture the maximum number of pieces. A player who captures the commander of a stack can only capture from the same stack in the same turn again if there is another intervening capture between the two captures from the stack. When a piece reaches the opposite end of the board from where it started, it becomes a king immediately. If it is promoted in the midst of a sequence of captures, it may begin to capture as a king immediately when it is promoted. Kings move any number of spaces in either direction. Kings may capture by hopping over any distance, as long as there are no intervening pieces, and may land on any space beyond the captured piece, as long as the move is in a straight line and the captured piece is the only piece in the line. When a king is capturing and there is a choice for where it ends it's capturing leap, an option which allows further captures must be taken if possible. Kings retain their rank when in a stack.

One player has a gold fleet consisting of one large flagship and twelve escorts, with the objective of evading capture while breaking through his or her opponent's blockade to transport the flagship to the perimeter of the board. The other player has a silver fleet of twenty ships, and forms a blockade to trap the gold flagship and destroy the gold fleet's escorts with the objective of capturing the flagship.

Setup
Gold player places the flagship on the center square of the game board, and positions the rest of the ships anywhere within the boldly ruled central area of the board.

Silver player then positions the silver ships on twenty squares in the lightly ruled peripheral area of the board.

Play
Gold player chooses who goes first. Players move alternately by making two moves or one capture anywhere on the board. When the flagship is moved, only one move or capture is made (thus only the flagship).

Moves
A player may move two of the smaller playing pieces any number of vacant squares either horizontally or vertically on the board (as a rook in Chess, except that no captures can be made with this move), although if the flagship is moved, the gold player may not move another playing piece.

Captures
A player may move any playing piece (including the flagship) one square diagonally to capture one of his opponent's playing pieces. (This move is similar to the capture-move of the pawn in Chess, except that captures can be made on any of the four diagonals.)

This game uses displacement capture (like Chess), rather than custodial capture (like Hnefatafl), thus when a capture is made, the captured piece is removed from the board and the vacated square is occupied by the captor.

"1552","1380","Default",NULL,NULL,"1",NULL,"Overview:
In Seesaw the players (North and South) command opposing armies with soldiers that can promote. Your army starts out as a single soldier and your promotion area evolves as you deploy more soldiers. Every time a soldier promotes it grows - first into a 2-stack, then a 3-stack, and so on. 

The central idea of Seesaw is the 2-fold significance of stack-size: 
(i) Odd-sized stacks move forwards, and even-sized stacks move backwards, and 
(ii) on any given turn, a stack can take as many steps as it likes from 1 up to its size. 

This results in soldiers seesawing up and down the board as their strength increases to the point where the game is forced to conclude in one side completely eliminating the other.

How to play:
On your turn, you must either make a stack-move, or place a new stack. 

1. Placing a new stack: 
A newly placed stack will always be of size 1. You may only place a stack on an empty cell next to a cell of your color. These cells are promotion cells, and each cell you place a new stack on automatically turns into a promotion cell of your color.

2. Stackmoves:
You only ever move one stack per turn, but that stack may be able to move several steps or capture several enemy stacks, depending on its size.
The number of steps a stack may take is the number of pieces in it, i.e. its size.

2.1 Non-capturing moves: On turns where you do not have to capture an enemy (see below) all the steps a stack takes is either constrained to the 3 upward directions or to the 3 downward directions, depending on the size and the owner of the stack. South's forward directions are the 3 upward directions, and North's forward directions are the 3 downward directions.

2.2 Capturing moves: If one or more of your stacks can reach an enemy by lifting the restraint on direction, you must capture such a reachable enemy by replacement. If that stack did not spend all its steps reaching the captured enemy, you can, before you end your turn, spend the left-over steps by making a non-capturing move.

Group: like-colored stones adjacent to each other. Singletons are considered groups of size 1.
Path: an empty point, or an uninterrupted straight line of empty points that have a pair of like-colored stones on both ends, which are not part of the same group. Such a pair is said to have a path.
Dead group: a group in which all stones belonging to it have no path. If any stone belonging to a group has a path, the group is said to have a path.

GAME PLAY (Overview)
Decide which player plays as which color (Light or Dark) in any adequate way.
Light goes first, then alternate turns.
On each player's first turn, players place a stone of their own color on any empty point.
On each player's second turn, players place another stone of their color so that their own two stones have a path.

Then players take actions below on each turn, in this order.
1. Remove all opponent’s dead groups. This happens automatically in Ludii.
2. Place a stone of their own color on an empty point that is on at least one same straight line with an existing friendly stone, and no opponent's stone in between. Passing is not allowed.

After the second turn, the player with no stones of their color on the board at the beginning of their turn loses.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"0,5520","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The holes on both ends of both players' inner rows are Kichwa, and the next holes in from those are the Kimbi. Players sow from one of their holes in either direction on the board. When the final counter lands in an occupied hole, these counters are picked up and sowing continues, when a capture is not possible. When the final counter lands in an empty hole, the turn ends.  Play begins with six counters in the Nyumba, two in each of the holes to its right, and 22 counters to be entered on the board.

Namua is the stage of the game where there are still counters to be placed on the board. During Namua, the Nyumba is the house, as long as it has at least six counters in it and it has not been emptied. Players place counters into an occupied hole in their front row. If this hole is opposite one of the opponent's occupied holes, the opponent's counters in that hole are captured. Captures must be made if possible. If a capture is not possible, the counter is placed into a hole and the contents of that hole are sown. The house cannot be emptied, but if it is the only occupied hole, the counter placed into it, and only that one counter, can be sown to one of the adjacent holes.  Sowing from a Kichwa in the direction of the back row is not allowed unless it is the only occupied hole in the front row. Players cannot place a counter in holes with single counters  unless only holes in the front row with single counters exist or the house is still present. If the final counter of a sowing lands in the house, the turn ends. Once all of the counters are placed on the board for both players, Namua ends.

The next stage begins. The rules for the house mentioned above during the Namua stage no longer apply, but the rules below remain in effect until the first capture in this phase of the game has been made.  Players alternate turns taking the counters from one of their holes that has more than one and less than sixteen counters and sowing them. When the final counter lands in an occupied hole in the front row opposite one of the opponent's occupied holes, the opponent's counters are captured, unless the hole from which sowing began contained sixteen or more counters. Captures must be made if possible. Single counters cannot be sown. Sowing must occur from an inner row hole when possible. A Kichwa cannot be sown toward the back row if it is the only occupied hole in the front row. 


Capturing rules:  The counters captured from the opponent's hole are captured and sown on the player's front row. If they were captured from a Kimbi or Kichwa, they must be sown from the nearest Kichwa. If they were not captured from one of these holes, they must be sown from the Kichwa in the direction toward which the sowing was proceeding when the capture was made. If the capture was not made from a Kimbi or Kichwa and it was not made while sowing, the player can choose which Kichwa to sow from. Further captures in the same turn must be made with this sowing if possible, and are made if the final counter lands in an occupied hole in the inner row which is opposite an occupied hole in the opponent's inner row. If a capture is not possible, the sowing must end in the house. When the final counter lands in the house, the player may choose to continue sowing from the house or to end their turn. If the player cannot capture and cannot drop the final counter in the house, they must sow into an occupied hole, and continue sowing from that hole. The player may sow such that the final counter lands in an empty hole only when none of the other options are possible.

When a player sows in such a way that they do not capture and the opponent is unable to capture on their next turn but the player will be able to capture on their own following move, the opponent cannot sow from this hole. The opponent is able to sow from such a hole if they can capture from this hole; if the hole in question is the house (this remains true for all phases of the game); if it is the only occupied hole in the front row; or if it is the only hole in the front row with greater than one counter. This rule does not apply during the Namua phase.

A player wins when their opponent's inner row holes are empty. This includes in the middle of sowing (e.g., sowing into the outer row directly from a Kichwa when it is the only occupied hole in the front row). A player may also lose if they only  have single counters in their holes.

The track is boustrophedon, starting in the bottom left corner and moving to the right, until it reaches the top right corner where it proceeds down the extended track. Six sticks, used as dice, with one polished side and one rough side. Throws equal the number of polished sides which land face-up, with the following exceptions: five polished or five rough sides = sig, this grants a move of one plus another throw, in which the player moves the number of polished sides up, six polished = sig of 6, grants the player another throw, and the player moves the number of polished sides up; if the second throw is regular sig, the value is 7, six rough = sig of twelve, grants the player three throws and the player moves the number of polished sides up; if any of those three extra throws are a regular sig, the total value of the extra throws is 13.

When all the pieces have been placed, the players take turns moving pieces on the board. The pieces can be moved orthogonally to any adjacent square. A piece can leap over any single piece of either color, if the square behind is unoccupied. Several leaps in one turn are possible (as in Draughts).
If a player can trap an enemy piece between two friendly pieces, the enemy piece is blocked and cannot be moved.
On the next turn, instead of moving a piece, the player can capture the trapped piece by removing it from the board, provided his own two surrounding pieces are still free. The trapped piece is immediately free if one of its two enemies is itself surrounded.
A player can only move a piece between two of the opponent's pieces if this move causes one of the opponent's pieces to be trapped.

            The mechanism is implemented like this: All men are stacks. Single pieces are stacks of size 1. Every time a man promotes a piece is added to it, so its stack size increases by 1. The following two-fold meaning of stack size is the key idea:
            1) Odd stacks step forwards and even stacks step backwards.
            2) A stack of size n can capture a piece up to n steps away in a straight line provided that there are no pieces between the capturing piece and its target, and that the square immediately behind the target in the capture direction is empty. The capturing piece must land there.
            
            Thus, the men gradually acquire the capturing power of a king in Thai Checkers as they seesaw up and down the board.

    Definitions:
-- A 'group' is any set of a stones that is comprised of a starting stone and all the stones which can be reached from it by a series steps between adjacent stones, where the mentioned stones are all the same color.

-- An 'eye' is either of:
1) a single empty site around which all the adjacent sites are occupied by pieces of a single group; or
2) an occupied site that was previously an eye.

-- An 'Immortal group' is a group with at least one eye.

-- Your 'territory' is the combination of your Immortal groups and their eyes.

Normal Play
Play starts on the empty board. Turns are a series of placements and/or captures. All placements are onto empty sites and adjacent to at most 1 enemy group.

On a normal turn, 
1) the player must first place a stone onto a site outside of both players' territories.

2) Thereafter, a series of placements are made, each placement adjacent to a different enemy group, until all the enemy groups have been played to once during the turn; -- EXCEPT THAT, if no placement can be made adjacent to the selected group, that group is removed instead. 

The removals can be made in any order. The chosen order can be important, since removing one group might prevent a different one from being removed.

-- Note that except for the first placement, the placements CAN be made into the eyes.

Passing is not allowed, except as allowed in the special cases below.

When the turn is complete the next player plays, until the winning player's territory covers over half the board. 

Exceptional Cases:
Since territory is only those groups with eyes, when the score is close and/or there are many pieces that are not connected to eyes, exceptional cases may arise. 

These are dealt with in order of priority, as follows:
1) If at the start of their turn, a player finds the position of all the pieces on the board to be the same as at the beginning of their last turn, the player must pass (unless the previous player just passed.)
2) If the player cannot legally place the first piece of their move, they must remove one eyeless enemy group and then pass.
3) If there is no group to remove, they must pass.

If both players pass consecutively before one has achieved majority territory, the game ends, and the territories are compared to see who has more. This can only occur if there is at least one unplayable site on the board between 2 friendly and 2 enemy territories, and the scores are very close. In such cases a tie is possible.

    To Net: Means to place a stone that reduces the edge liberties of a region, which contains the opponent's stones, to such a degree that the available edge cells (liberties) no longer exceeds the number stones contained in the region. Netting an opponent's stones wins the game.
    
    Netting can be done by filling the edges, or by cutting off connections to part or all of the edge -- for example by placing 3 stones in a triangle around an individual piece.
    
    Suicide: is a placement of your own stone into a region defined by the opponent's net, bringing your stone count there up to the number of edges cells in the region.
    
    Suicide is not allowed.
    
    Play:
    
    Black starts with an empty board.
    On your turn place one of your stones on an empty site that has enough liberties to avoid Suicide.

"1663","1450","Ikibuguzo (Opening 2)",NULL,"Played in Bugufi and Burundi.","3","These rules were played in Burundi and the Bugufi area of Tanzania in the early twentieth century.","4x8 board. Two counters in each hole. Opening play:  Players rearrange their counters so that there are four counters in each hole of their outer row. If they play with the second array, they take turns sowing from each of the holes with four  counters, beginning with the rightmost hole, placing two in the first hole and one in each of the following. Main phase: Play begins from any hole on the player's side of the board with counters in it. Singletons cannot move. Sowing happens in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands in an empty hole, the turn is over. For capturing: Holes are in 'opposition' when one player has the front row hole occupied and the opponent has both of the holes opposite it occupied. If the last hole in a sowing is in opposition, the player takes the counters in both of the opponent's holes and places them in the empty hole from which the player lifted the counters. The player then sows the captured counters from this hole. Further captures in the sowing can occur in the same way. However, each player has two hole from which clockwise plays can be made: the leftmost hole in the outer row and the second from the left in the inner row. Clockwise moves can only be made from these holes if they immediately lead to a capture. When the captured counters are sown, starting from the same hole, they can also be sown clockwise if they lead to a capture. If they cannot lead to a capture, they are sown anti-clockwise. Another alternative the player has is that, if the player plays clockwise from one of these holes and therefore makes a capture, the captured counters may be placed in the hole and left there, and the player may play instead from the other hole from which clockwise captures are allowed in a clockwise direction, if it leads to a capture. The player may continue playing from this hole as above until the possibilities to move are exhausted, and then may move from any hole in an anti-clockwise direction. Multiple captures can only be made in a clockwise direction from these holes if it is made on the first sowing of the turn. Otherwise, only one clockwise capture can be made and sowing must proceed in an anti-clockwise direction. If the last counter lands on a hole that is occupied but not in opposition, these counters are picked up and sowing continues. Play ends when one player captures all the opponent's counters or one player cannot play. The player who cannot play loses. A player may also win by capturing the counters from both of the opponent's end holes in the inner row in a single turn.

Play
- Decide which player will play with which color (Dark or Light).
- Light is the first player to play.
- Players take turns moving one of their own pieces
- Passing is not allowed.

Ending the game:
The game ends when one player's pieces all form a single group. That player wins. If tied, the moving player wins.

Note: The Game 'Constellation' can also end in Stalemate if a player cannot move. In this case the last to move loses.

How to make a move:
1) Choose a piece to play.
2) Note the size of the first friendly group in each direction. (If the piece is not a singleton, one of these is the group the piece is part.)
3) The largest of these gives the starting value for the move.
4) Try to move the chosen piece in any of the six radial directions.
-- (In Astralesce, as the piece moves it will capture every opponent's piece that it reaches.)
5) For the piece to be able to move, it must stop on a destination at which it has a higher value than before.
-- The ending value is found in the same way as the starting value was found: It is the size of largest of the nearest friendly groups on a radial line from the new location.


Notes on what to look for to find moves quickly:
A) move to join the largest group in-line with the piece.
B) If the piece is already in the largest in-line group, then move to connect that group to another.
C) move to join a non-in-line group that is at least as big as the largest in-line group
D) move to connect 2 groups to make the result larger than the largest in-line group
E) find the all the lines radiating from all pieces of all groups that are larger than the largest in-line group, and move to a location on one of those lines.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"0,5520","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Pieces move as follows: Raja (King, x1): moves one space in any direction; Mantri (Minister, placed to the left of the Raja, x1): moves any distance orthogonally or diagonally; Queen (x1, placed to the right of the Raja); moves orthogonally one space; Prince (placed to the left of the Minister, x1), moves orthogonally or diagonally any distance; Ushtra (Camel, x2): moves diagonally any distance; Chariot (x2), moves orthogonally any distance; Flagcar (x2), moves diagonally any distance; Vaha (Horse, x2): move orthogonally one space and then diagonally another, jumping over any intervening pieces; Danti (Elephant, x2): moves orthogonally any distance. Padati (Pawn, x14): move forward orthogonally one space or one space diagonally forward to capture. When a Padati reaches the opposite edge of the board, it is promoted to a Mantri and is moved immediately to the space it last moved from. An opponent's piece is captured by moving one of the player's own pieces onto the space occupied by the opponent's piece. If the Raja can be captured on the opponent's next turn, it is in check. The Raja cannot be in check at the end of the player's turn. If this is impossible, the opponent wins. When a player is reduced to only their Raja and Padati, the opponent wins. In the case of a stalemate, the player in stalemate may remove any of the opponent's pieces (except their Raja).

(To offset any advantage Black has in moving first, the pie rule is used: White can choose to switch sides after Black's first move, playing from then on as Black. White has this option only after Black's first move.) 

The game is executed in two phases:

1) Placement phase. Players take turns placing one of their pieces on any open point on the board. No placements result in a capture in this phase. A player can win the game in this phase if they are able to occupy all four corners of a board square; otherwise, play proceeds to the Movement phase once all 24 pieces have been placed.

2) Movement phase. For their turn, a player may either:
- move one of their pieces along a straight line to an adjacent empty point; or,
- remove a neutral piece from the board—but only if no white or black piece is adjacent to it.

Capturing moves are possible in the Movement phase. If the points of a triangle contain exactly one white and one black piece, either player can capture the opponent piece by occupying the remaining open point (""cornering"" the enemy piece on the triangle). 

If a move simultaneously corners two opponent pieces on two different triangles, then neither enemy piece is captured. A piece can move safely to a triangle point even if the other two points of the triangle are occupied by enemy pieces.

A player wins by being the first to occupy all four corners (points) of a board square with their pieces.

"1772","1485","Default",NULL,NULL,"1",NULL,"The rules are as follows:

1. Starting a game:
- Each player takes 7 chips of one color.
- No two players may start with the same color chips.
- This player places a chip onto the playing area, and selects any other player to be the next person to move.

2. Playing the game:
- Move by playing a chip of any color onto the playing area (starting a new pile), or on top of any existing chip(s) in the playing area.
- If no chips are captured (see below), the player selects the next person to move, so long as that person's starting chip color is not in the stack just played on (this may be the same person, if that person used a captured chip). However, if all four colors are in the stack just played on, the next person must be the player whose most-recently played chip (by color) is furthest down in the stack
- Chips are captured by playing two chips of the same color consecutively on one pile. The player designated by that color must kill one chip of their choice out of that pile, and take the rest. Then they get the next move. Killed chips are taken out of the game.
- A chip is a prisoner when held by a player other than the original owner.
- Any prisoner in a player's possession may be killed or transferred to another player at any time. Such transfers are unconditional and cannot be retracted. A player may not transfer or kill chips of their own color.
- A player is defeated when given the move, but has no chips in their possession (and hence is unable to play).
  a. Defeat is not final until every player holding prisoners has refused to rescue the defeated player by transferring chips.
  b. After defeat, the move returns to the player who gave the defeated player the move.
  c. The defeated player's chips remain in play as prisoners, but are ignored in determining the order of play.
  d. If a pile is captured by the chips of a defeated player, the entire pile is killed, and the move rebounds to the capturing player.

3. Order of play:
- If a capture occurs: the player whose color made the capture gets the next move.
- If a player is defeated: move returns to the player who gave the defeated player the move. If this should also defeat that player in turn, whoever gave that player the move will get the next turn, etc.
- Otherwise, the next player to move is decided by last player to have moved as follows:
  a. They may give the move to any player (including themselves) whose color is not represented in the pile just played upon.
  b. If all players are represented in that pile, the move goes to the player whose most-recently played chip is furthest down in the pile.

4.Winning the game:

A piece can kick the ball if the ball is adjacent to it (i.e., a kings move away.)

Each player moves one ship each turn. A ship moves any number of empty squares in a straight line, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally (that is, like a chess queen). However, a ship may never end its turn in its home port.

DESTROYING SHIPS
Two opposing ships ""attack"" each other if they face each other along a straight line with no other ships between them (so that each could move to the other's square). A ship that is under attack from three or more enemy ships is ""vulnerable."" At the end of your move, you must destroy all vulnerable enemy ships by removing them from the board. In the example below, the white ship on b3 is under attack from black ships on
a2, b1, and d3, and can be destroyed. You can only destroy enemy ships after your move. Sometimes, if an enemy ship
is vulnerable at the beginning of your turn, your move in that turn will make it no longer vulnerable. When this happens, you cannot destroy the ship. If the destruction of one ship makes another ship vulnerable that wasn't vulnerable before, both ships must be destroyed. In the example below, destroying the white ship on f8 makes the ship on g8 vulnerable. Both are destroyed.

REBUILDING SHIPS
At the beginning of your turn, you may rebuild one of your destroyed ships. The ship is placed in your home port, and since ships may not end a turn in their own port, you must use your turn to move the ship out of port. Therefore, you cannot rebuild a ship until you have a vacant square to move the ship to.

Ten counters in each large space, with five in each smaller space. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. When a counter falls in an occupied space, the contents of the following space are picked up and sowing continues. If the following space is one of the large spaces, one of the counters from the large space is picked up and sown into the next space. When the following space is empty, if there is another space following the empty space the turn ends. If the space following the empty space contains counters, these are captured. If the next space after the one in which the capture was made is also empty, followed by a space with counters, these are also captured, continuing with any unbroken sequence of empty and occupied spaces.

When one player has no counters in their spaces, they place five of their captured counters, one in each of their spaces, and continue to play.

Play ends when both of the large spaces are empty. The players evenly split any remaining counters on the board.

A new round begins. Players fill their spaces with their captured stones. The player with fewer counters must then ""sell"" spaces on their side to the opponent to have enough counters to fill the holes. If the difference in the number of captured counters is less than ten, the opponent is given half-ownership of a space, and the contents of it at the end of the game are split between the two players. If the difference is ten, the opponent then may take all of the stones from a sold space at the end of the game. The player may regain sold spaces on subsequent rounds by capturing ten counters more than their opponent. The game is then played as before. Games are played until three or four squares in the same row have been sold. The winner is the player who has captured the three or four spaces.

			Definitions:

			A group is an entire set of connected stones of the same color. A single stone, not connected to others of its color, is also a group.
			A group is dead if there is no path of connected empty cells between that group and any other of its color.

			Play:

			On your turn, perform the following actions in the stated order:

			1. Place a stone of your color on an empty cell. If it is your first turn of the game, perform this action twice.
			2. Remove all dead enemy groups.
			3. Remove all dead friendly groups.

			The board positions at the start and at the end of your turn must be different.

			The last player to make a placement wins. Note that, after your first turn, you will always have a placement available unless you have no groups on the board.
			
			To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.

			Note that, in this implementation, the two stones you place on your first turn are only visible after both cells to place on have been selected.

            Alternative balancing methods:

			The balancing method described above is what is called 'strong pie' in the options. 
			This implementation also offers two other methods, for players who would like to explore alternatives.

			Weak pie: Just like with strong pie, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.
			But instead of placing twice on their first move, players alternate placing one piece each (with no removals) until 4 setup stones are placed.
			Consequently, White's choice will be made after Black has placed only one stone.
			            
			Komi pie: The first player chooses a whole number of komi (between 1 and 12) and the second player chooses whether to play as White (pass) or as Black (place a stone).
			The first 4 stones are placed in the same order as with weak pie (Black, White, Black, White).
			Throughout the game proper, White will have the option to spend a point of komi instead of making a placement.

     --- Otherwise:---
    B) if the previous player has played in a way that prevents placement, then instead, a piece must be moved to an adjacent empty location that meets the same destination restriction as for placement. 
    
    However, a player may not be deprived of placement moves for more turns in a row than he has pieces in play at the start of his turn. If the number of his pieces at the start of his turn is equal to or less than the number of movement turns that he has already taken since his last placement, then he has been stalemated and the game ends in his favor.
    
    He would also be stalemated if there were no legal step moves available on the board.
    
    Removals:
    After the placement or movement, simultaneously remove every piece on the board that is adjacent to pieces of all 3 values without respect to ownership of the pieces and of their neighbors.

A 'chain' is any set of player's stones that comprised of a starting stone and every stone which can be reached from it by a series steps between adjacent stones.

Starting with an empty board, players alternate taking turns.

A turn consists of either placing or moving a stone followed by removing opposing stones, if applicable.

Placing:
A friendly stone may be placed either:
- 1) where there are no adjacent stones of either player, or
- 2) where the number of stones in adjacent chains that belong to the opponent equal those that belong to the player including the stone to be placed.

For example: A stone may be placed next to an opponent's 1-chain (isolated stone).

Moving:
B) A friendly stone may be moved one step to an empty site, but only if the number of chains on the board is reduced by merger and the merged chain becomes at least as large as every opponent's chain that it is adjacent to.

Special movement restrictions:
Pieces may not step to merge with a chain that is the larger than any other chain on the board. This restriction does not affect the placement rule. It also does not apply if more than one group is tied for largest.

Removing stones:
After placement or movement, the player removes every opponent's stone that is directly adjacent to a larger friendly chain than its own.

When the turn is completed, only chains of equal size remain in contact.

Ending the game:
There is no passing. The game ends when either player is unable to move.

Players begin with soldiers, equal in number to the number of spaces in one row for each player, which begin in the spaces in the row closes to the player. Each player has one king piece, which begins in the rightmost space in the central row with respect to the player. Four six-sided dice with values from 1-6. A throw of 1 is called Chong. Pieces move in a boustrophedon path along the board, from left to right in their home row, right to left in the center row, and then left to right in their opponent's row. 

A player must first throw a Chong to play. On this turn, when a player throws one Chong, the King exchanges places with the soldier behind it. If more than one Chong is thrown, the King exchanges places with the soldier that many spaces behind it. Any remaining values in the throw are moved by the soldier which took the king's space. Once this move has taken place, pieces move according to the throws of the dice, which can be subdivided between the pieces as the player sees fit. The King only moves with a Chong, and it exchanges the place of a piece that number of occupied squares away, i.e., only spaces occupied by the player's pieces are counted when moving the King. When the player has only one soldier and the King, the King may move normally (like a soldier does), but on throws of Chong. When only the King is left, the first Chong in a throw is ignored and only the second, third, or fourth Chongs are moved.  

When a player's piece lands on a space occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured. An opponent's King cannot be taken by a soldier until it has first moved backwards, and then it can only be taken by a Chong.

The dark squares make up the house of the Dark player, and the light squares make up the house of the Light player. The goal is to empty your opponent's house.

There are two types of moves in Overflow, both of which are sowing moves, somewhat akin to what you see in mancalas. All moves are bound by the restriction that there must always be exactly one orthodiagonally connected group of stacks on the board. The one kind of sowing only drops pieces onto already occupied squares and the other kind spills out of both the group of already occupied squares and out of the board itself, hence the names: contained moves and overflow moves.

Sowing in general:
Sowing in general is picking up a stack from any square and distributing its pieces along one of the 8 directions onto a contiguous line of squares – usually placing one of the N pieces from the chosen stack in each of the N or so squares in the sowing direction. The details are given below.

Overflow moves:
An overflow move involves sowing into empty squares – possibly in addition to occupied squares – and over the edge of the board. It's important to remember that these two things always go together in this game, namely (1) sowing over the edge and (2) sowing into empty squares. That is to say, if you are to sow into one or more empty squares, the number of squares in the chosen sowing direction must be smaller than the number of stones in the chosen stack. The pieces that end up outside the board are removed from the game.

Contained moves:
Contained moves only sow onto already occupied squares. A contained move must sow the chosen stack as far as possible. If it's impossible to sow each of the pieces in the stack into an occupied square of its own, you place the remainder of the pieces on the last occupied square you reached. You are not obligated to chose the stack that can be sown the farthest, but whatever stack you chose, if you do not make an overflow move move with it, you must chose a sowing direction that allows you to sow onto as many occupied squares as possible.

You may always chose freely between contained moves and overflow moves when both kinds are available.

Note that no stack will have both a contained move and an overflow move available in the same direction. All moves are completely determined by the choice of stack and direction.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"0,5520","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Passing is not allowed in Redstone. Players will always have a placement available and must make one.

GROUPS AND LIBERTIES: 
A group is an orthogonally interconnected collection of one or more like-colored stones. 
Only black groups and white groups will be discussed here, not red groups. 
A liberty is an unoccupied point adjacent to a (black or white) group

CAPTURES:
A capturing placement results in one or more groups, of either or both colors, having no liberties. 
Such a placement can only be made with a red stone. 
Conversely, a red stone can only be placed if it bounds (completely deprives of liberties) one or more groups of either or both colors. Red stones are permanent. They cannot themselves be captured.
Self capture is allowed.

When multiple groups without liberties result from a placement, all such groups are removed immediately following said placement, regardless of the groups' colors. Unlike Go, if you unbound your own temporarily bounded group by removing a neighboring enemy group, you must still remove your own temporarily bounded group.

PIE RULE:
Since Redstone is a game of annihilation, not of point score, Go’s komi can’t be used.
Instead, Redstone uses the pie rule for balance.

MOVES
Players make one move per turn, starting with Red. There are three possible
types of moves, explained below. Players will always have a move available,
and must make one. Passing is not allowed.

NON-CAPTURING MOVES
Kings and courtesans can move to an adjacent, unoccupied square in any of
the three forward directions.

CAPTURING MOVES
Kings and courtesans can move to an adjacent, enemy occupied square in any
of eight directions, capturing the enemy king or courtesan by replacement.

EXCHANGE MOVE
You can transfer the top checker of your king onto an adjacent, friendly
courtesan in any of the three forward directions, thus exchanging king and
courtesan.

"1994","1597","Default",NULL,NULL,"1",NULL,"Polypods is a game about groups of connected stones called Polypods.
    
    Understanding the mythical life of a polypod should help you to easily remember the rules.
    
    Polypods are creatures that have poisonous body segments that tie together its numerous feet. To survive, at least half of a polypod must be its feet, and this determines how they may grow and the shapes they may take. 
    
    The feet die and fall off upon contact with the poisonous body segments of other polypods,  however, since the feet themselves are not poisonous, there is no harm in their contact with other polypod's feet. Fortunately a polypod's foot is able to smell the area around it, and thus a polypod avoids extending its feet to touch the bodies of competing polypods.
    
    Hungry polypods do, however, find ways to bring their body against a foot of another polypod, causing that foot (or feet) to self-amputate.     If the attacking polypod is lucky, the loss of a foot will cause its neighbor to die. 
    
    The attacking polypod then ingests the body of its dead neighbor and spawns new polypods in the dead neighbor's feet.
    
    Definitions:
-- A POLYPOD is a group of interconnected stones. The group includes every stone of the same color that is connected to it.
(A single stone, or monopod, is also considered as a polypod in these rules.)

Each stone in a polypod has one of two roles: Body or foot.   
-- FOOT STONES (FEET) are stones that connect to at most two other friendly stones:- and if connected to two stones, those two must already be adjacent to each other. 
-- BODY STONES are those that serve to link all the polypod feet together. 

As the polypods grow or shrink, the roles of their individual stones change accordingly.
(In this application the body stones are marked with squares for convenience in reading the board.)

A polypod is ALIVE if it has at least as many feet as body stones.

-- Foot stones in contact with a body stone of the opposite color SELF-AMPUTATE (ie get immediately removed from the board)
-- when a Polypod DIES, its body stones are removed, and its feet change ownership.

Rules:
The game uses discs played on the intersections of a triangular grid of the desired size and shape. 
The board starts empty and Dark starts. Turns Alternate.

The moving player, either passes, or does the following sequence of actions, if possible:
1. The mover places a piece on an empty space.
-- The placement must not cause the immediate self-amputation of the placed stone.
-- It may add to or merge friendy polypods, UNLESS this would cause those polypod(s) to die.
2. The mover removes all self-amputating feet.
3. The mover resolves all polypod deaths.

The game ends when the players pass consecutively.

The winner is determined by tallying the value of each player's polypods.
The value of a polypod is the number of body stones that it contains.
If tied, score all the empty spaces adjacent to the players' own polypods.
If this count is also equal, the game is considered a draw.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"0,5520","0",NULL,"0","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

    -- 'Eating' is the removal of an adjacent bug of the same type.
    
    Play:

    Bug mergers are never allowed.
    Note! A player who CANNOT move, WINS.
    
    Required growth:
    -- The moving player must place a stone to grow a bug.
    -- This first growth in a turn must not result in a bug that is larger than all the other bugs on the board.
    
    Successive cycles of eating and growth:
    If there are any bugs that can be eaten, a new Eat-and-Bonus-Growth cycle must be taken.
    
    Eating
    -- A bug is chosen to do the eating.

            If you can move you have to do so, even if it is a bad move.
            If you stalemate yourself, the other player can move until you can move again.
            
            STARTER-generation: If you reach the same color of one of your own pieces in the opposite ring, you get a new starter to your base (center of the rings) from your reserve. This also works from the base with a start-move (base to own ring).
            
            To CAPTURE an enemy, you need to be able to reach the same color of the enemy-piece in the opposite ring, then the possibility to directly capture the enemy on its board-position will be available.
            Capturing is not mandatory, you can also just go to the opposite-color position (move 'into the shadow'). Capturing with a start-move from the base is not possible.
            Ring Capture: with step lenght 8 you could theoretically move in a circle to your own position, but as normal move this is not allowed.
            But if there is an enemy-piece on the opposite same color, the (ring-)capture-move is not allowed! For step lengths of 12 or 14 etc this is also possible from some other positions.
            
            The captured pieces remain under the attacker in a stack and have to be brought to the Transmitter (field in the middle of the board) with the according step length.
            If you reach the transmitter, your pieces in the stack go back to base as starters, and the enemies land in your prison.
            First player to make 3 prisoners wins.
            
            Only pieces with a captured enemy can land on the Transmitter for prisoner transport. (Exception: #LastMan)
            Single pieces just step over it. With high step length you can move in circles or to the other side and back, but not turn 180 degrees.
            
            Special Rules to balance the Start:
            From the Start-situation (or later, when there are temporarily no pieces on colored positions) you cannot copy the move of the enemy, ie move to the same color with your first piece.
            
            #CounterAttack: If your first starter is attacked immediately (by the first enemy move), you are allowed to start also to the colors in the enemy-ring with your second starter. In this case, there is no Starter generation, if you move to the opposite color of your first piece (to protect it from capturing).
            
            Special Rules for Endgame:
            #LastMan: If you are left with just a single piece on the colored board positions (and no starter on your base), you may enter the Transmitter to move the piece to your base and get a second starter (if you still have one in your reserve)!
            
            #PrisonerExchange: Move a prisoner to your (empty) homebase, and you get an additional Starter taken from your reserve & the prisoner goes back to his reserve. You have to move this new starter immediately: the Prisoner Exchange itself counts not as a full move.

            Strategy : Early starter-generation is important to have more options.
            Indirect or dynamic defence is sometimes best: if you are captured, to be able to capture back or dominate the opponent with controlling many positions is vital.
            In general, a move that attacks an enemy-piece and would make possible a Starter-Generation in the next move simultaneously, is good.
            
            But be aware: almost all moves change the step length and attack & defence-patterns, ie. the whole situation.

Upon reaching the last rank, Pawns promote to any major piece except a king.
    -- There are no initial double moves, nor en passant.
    
    Bishops (2): Can move like chess queens - any orthogonal direction or allowed diagonal direction (but not across light squares).
    
    Knights (2) move one space orthogonally and one space diagonally, in either order to reach a non-adjacent destination. The intermediate position may be occupied. Knights capture at their destination, but if the destination is empty, they capture an enemy along their path.
    
     Queen (1): can move any number of spaces diagonally only, but once per turn, may change direction while crossing a dark square. They capture an enemy at the destination.
     
     Kings (1): can move one space orthogonally or diagonally. The King can move twice per turn, but not in the same direction nor back to the same place. A King may capture on both parts of its turn, but only if the piece(s) captured is not defended. 
     
     Checks:  A check is a threat to take a king, or a threat on a site that the king passes through.
     -- The King may not move across- nor to- a position that remains in check at the completion of its full turn. Nor may a king be put into check by the movement of another friendly piece, including by the opening of a space that allows a knight to jump across the king, or opening a space between opposing kings.
     
     Note: While a king may not move across an open site under check, it may still threaten check across it, thus preventing the opposing king from occupying those sites -- because if the opposing king were captured at those sites, the game would be over and all checks would be null, including those on the intervening site. 
     A king does not threaten check across an occupied site.

You also need a large supply of black and white stones and 5 distinguishable (e.g. by color) shared sets of 12 tiles. That is, each of the 5 sets contain 12 tiles, for 60 tiles in total.

Setup:
Before play begins, all 60 tiles and 2 white and 2 black stones are distributed randomly on the 64 squares of the board.
A short balancing phase then ensues:

One player swaps the position of any number of stones with a tile. That is, for 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 of the stones, swap its position with any tile.
When all stones have been swapped, or the swapping player passes, indicating that they do not wish to swap any more stones, the other player choses to play first as Black or second as White in the proper playing phase.
(To show the button for swapping in Ludii, you might have to click the three dots next to the pass button.)

The balancing phase can be skipped by new players, or you can agree on a fixed setup for the 4 initial stones.

Play:
In this phase (the proper playing phase), players take turns, starting with Black, placing stones of their own color.
On your turn, place a stone of your color on a square adjacent to one of your stones already on the board.
You may not place a stone on a square occupied by a stone. I.e. the square you place at must be empty or only occupied by a tile.
Stones placed on tiles normally just stack on top of them, however:
If a placement makes you have a stone on half of the tiles of a certain color, remove all tiles of that color along with the stones stacked on top of them (regardless of whether they're friendly or enemy).

Players take turns by placing stones of their color on the hexagonal cells. At the beginning of your turn you are given a new stone. You can either play it, or bide. If you bide, set the stone aside and your turn ends immediately. The stone remains in your hand. If you play the new stone while having at least one stone in your hand, you may release, meaning you would play every stone in your hand in succession. If a player releases, all players must release on their next turn, including playing their stone for that turn. Stones when placed create shock waves, pushing all adjacent stones one space radially outward from the placement. If there are multiple connected stones adjacent to the placed stone, positioned directly in line of the shock wave, they all move one space. If this movement causes a stone to bump into another stone directly in line of the shock wave, that stone also gets pushed one space. Becoming adjacent along a different grid line than the shockwave does not count. However stones cannot be pushed past the edge of the board. Lines that are full between the edges and the placed stone cannot move. Players eventually score points when all cells are filled up with stones. Each stone is worth points equal to its distance from the edge, starting at zero. Groups consist of connected adjacent like colored stones. The player with the highest scoring group wins.

     Markers if the number of pieces owned by Player the moving player is greater than 3, step adjacent, else from vertex in the location of the piece to vertex in the set of empty vertexs moveRule: true.
Players take turns moving.
Rules: 
     If in the same turn, remove pieces at sites occupied by any component owned by Next in Board, else from vertex in Player the moving player's hand site 0 to vertex in the set of empty vertexs moveRule: true then if a player places 3 of their pieces in an orthogonal direction line, move again if in the same turn, remove pieces at sites occupied by any component owned by Next in Board, else if the number of pieces owned by Player the moving player is greater than 3, move one of your pieces, else from vertex in sites occupied by any component owned by Mover to vertex in the set of empty vertexs moveRule: true.
Aim: 
     If the number of pieces owned by Player the next player is less than or equal to 2, the moving player wins.

 -- 2) If any new Mixed Triangles are created, a Capture is made by removing one opponent's piece from one of them.

 Goal: Largest Group (in Misere, the largest Group loses.)

Definitions:
A Group is a set of all the pieces that can be reached from any one of them by a series of steps, where a step means movement from one piece to another of the same color, next to it.

Note: For the Diagonal-Linked Group options a step also include diagonals (double-steps that are not in the same grid direction).

A site is a board intersection.

'Between' Variant:
-- A Capture site is any site adjacent to two stones of opposite color in the same line (i.e. directly between them.)

'Diagonal' Variant:
-- A Capture site is any site adjacent to each of two stones of opposite color, where those stones are not on the same grid-line.

Play:
Players take turn, starting on an empty board with White to play.

On a turn
1) The mover places to an empty site that is not a Capture site.
2) Then, if possible, the mover removes one of the opponent's checkers from a Capture site that lies adjacent to the placement just made.

In the case of Misere, the mover must take an additional turn after each capture.

Otherwise, the next player becomes the mover.

Pieces may only move one space per turn either straight forward, diagonally forward, or sideways along a line onto a vacant adjacent intersection point. They cannot move backwards in any direction until they are promoted to Kings. However, pieces can make capturing moves backward.
Captures are compulsory.
Captured pieces are removed from the board.
For pieces that have not yet been promoted to King, their captures are done by the short leap as in draughts and Alquerque. A piece leaps over an adjacent enemy piece onto a vacant adjacent intersection point on the other side. The leap must be in a straight line following the pattern on the board. Even pieces that are not yet promoted to King can capture enemy pieces backwards. A player's piece must continue to capture within a turn provided each capture meets the criteria of the short leap.
A piece is promoted to King when it reaches the other player's first rank.
Kings can move any number of unoccupied spaces in any available direction following the pattern of the board like the King in international draughts.
Kings can leap over an enemy piece (and only one enemy piece per leap) from any distance and land any distance behind it onto a vacant intersection point as in the King in international draughts. The King must continue to capture within the turn if it is able to do so.

Definitions:
-- Site Power: For a given player, each site's power is equal to the amount by which the adjacent friendly pieces exceed the amount of all the rest of the adjacent pieces. If a site is occupied, the piece at the site is also counted as an adjacent piece.
-- Territory: A player's 'Territory' is all the sites where he has positive power, plus all the sites he occupies where no other player has positive power.
-- Uncontrolled site: An empty site which is not part of any player's territory is called an 'uncontrolled site'.

Play:
Turns alternate starting with White.
To begin the turn, a player places a piece on an empty site.
-- The piece must be placed on a site the mover controls, if possible.
-- If this placement is not possible, the piece is placed onto an uncontrolled site.

-- These step moves are all optional. 
-- Unused bonus moves may not be saved for use in future turns.
