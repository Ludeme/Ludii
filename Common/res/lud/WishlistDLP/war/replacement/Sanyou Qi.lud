Ju(Chariot x2: moves any number of spaces orthogonally; Pao (Catapult/cannon) x2: can move orthogonally any number of spaces, captures by jumping one piece (of either player); Flag x2: moves orthogonally two spaces, but in an opponent's home rectangle can move orthogonally any distance. Fire x2: moves diagonally one space forward. Zu(Private/soldier) x3: can move one space forward. Once they move into an enemy's home rectangle, they can also move one space horizontally. Ma and Ju cannot cross the sea; Pao cannot cross. city wall or mountain. When a Jiang can be taken on the next turn, the player must move the Jiang so that it cannot be taken on the next turn.
