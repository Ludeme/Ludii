        (description "Played by the Tiwa Puebloans in the Southwest United States. It is a game, with a similar board and starting position as Cercar la Liebre, but the goal is for the player with the greater number of stones to move to the opposite side of the board instead of blocking the other player from moving.")
        (aliases {"Fuego de la Liebre"})
        (rules "One player has a single piece, the other has twelve, playing as jackrabbits. The player playing as the jackrabbits attempts to move all of their pieces to the opposite side of the board until they form the same configuration as the starting position on the opposite side. Pieces move orthogonally to accomplish this. The opponent's goal is to capture one of the jackrabbits by hopping over it.")
