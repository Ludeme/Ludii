        (description "Fox and Geese is a game known from medieval Europe with a complicated history. Many different versions are known, and it spread to many places that encountered Europeans and was adopted in various places with local rules. It is still played today, and it was thought that during the medieval and early modern period it was played by poorer classes of people, at least in England. In general, it is a typical hunt game.")

The geese begin in a set starting position; the person playing as the fox may choose any available spot to place the fox as their first move. Players move as in Alquerque, but only the fox can hop to capture. The goal of the geese is to block the fox from being able to move; the fox's goal is to capture all of the geese."))
