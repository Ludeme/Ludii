        (rules "12x12 checkered board. One player plays with six \"cattle\" or \"dogs,\" the other plays as the \"leopard.\" The cattle start on the white spaces along one side of the board, the leopard may be placed on any white square. Cattle move one space forward diagonally. The leopard may move one or two spaces diagonally in any one direction. If the leopard moves past the line of cattle, the leopard wins. If the cattle block the leopard from being able to move, the cattle win.")
