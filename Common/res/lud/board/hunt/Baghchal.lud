One player has four tigers, placed on the corners, and the other has up to 20 goats, placed on the board on a free space. Tigers and goats can move to an adjacent intersection along the lines on the board. Tigers may capture goats by hopping over them. The game ends when tigers have captured all of the goats or the goats block the tigers from being able to move."))
