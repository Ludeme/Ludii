        (rules "5x5 intersecting lines, with diagonals in each 3x3 quadrant. One player plays with two tigers, which begin on the central spot. The other player plays as 24 goats. The goats play first, and may place a piece on any empty spot. The tigers move to an empty spot any distance along the lines on the board, or may hop over an adjacent goat to capture it, provided there is an empty spot immediately on the other side of the goat. Once all of the goats are placed, they may move along the lines to an empty adjacent spot. If the tigers cannot move, the goats win. The tigers win by capturing all the goats.")
