        (description "Shi Liu Kan Tsiang Kün is a hunt game from nineteenth century China. Sixteen pieces play against one general. The game was played by children and day laborers on boards drawn on the street.")
        (aliases {"Shi Liu Kan Tsiang Kün" "Shap Luk Kon Tseung Kwan"})
        (rules "Board with 5x5 lines, diagonals drawn in the four quadrants of the board, and a triangle at the top, connecting the apex with the three central points at the top edge, and a line perpendicularly bisecting the height of the triangle. One player plays as the general, placed in the central position. The other player plays with sixteen pieces, arranged on the perimeter points of the square. Pieces move one spot along the lines on the board. The general may capture pieces when it moves into a space that is surrounded on two opposite sides, along the lines on the board, thus capturing the pieces on either side of it. Conversely, the general can be captured by surrounding it on two opposite sides with pieces. Only the general may enter the triangle. The goal of the general is to capture all of the opponent's pieces, the goal of the person playing with sixteen pieces is to capture the general. If the general becomes trapped in the triangle, the opponent wins.")
