        (description "Komikan is a game played in South America, particularly well-known in Chile. It is first mentioned in a text by J. I. Molina in 1787, describing it as a game of Chess. Subsequent authors have doubted the identification of this game as Chess, and have largely agreed that it is indeed a hunt game popular among the Araucanians from the nineteenth century, also known as \"Leoncito.\" It is a hunt game, played on an Alquerque-type board with a triangular appendage. It may be derived from the game Komina (also Taptana) known from Inka times.")

The dogs may move one space forward, the lion may move one space in any direction, and may also hop over a dog to capture it. The lion may make multiple hops in one turn. The goal of the dogs is to block the lion from moving; the lion's goal is to capture all the dogs."))
