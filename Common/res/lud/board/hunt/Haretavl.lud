        (rules "Square board, divided into eight equal triangles, with the central horizonal line extended past the square on either side and lines connecting the end point to the two nearby cornes of the square One player plays as the hare, the other player as three hounds. Players take turns placing one of their pieces on the board. When a player has placed all their pieces, they move to an adjacent empty spot. When the hounds block the hare from being able to move, the hounds win.
