(description "Len Cúa Kín Ngoa is a capturing game played in Thailand in the early nineteenth century. It is somewhat of a combination of a hunt and a capturing game, where one player plays as tigers and the other as cattle, but both are able to capture via different methods.")
(aliases {"Len Cúa Kín Ngoa"})
(rules "4x4 board. One player plays as four tigers, which begin the board placed in the four corner spaces. The other player plays as twelve oxen. The first move is made by placing one of the oxen on an empty space, followed by a move by the tiger closest to the ox. Players continue alternating moves, the oxen player placing an ox and the tiger player moving a tiger. When moving, pieces move to an empty adjacent spot orthogonally. Once all of the oxen are placed, the players alternate turns moving their pieces on the board. Pieces may capture another piece by hopping over an adjacent opponent's piece to an empty space immediately on the opposite side of it. Tigers capture orthogonally, oxen capture diagonally. Oxen may also capture a tiger by blocking it from being able to move. The oxen win by reducing the tigers to two.")
