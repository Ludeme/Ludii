        (description "This game is presented in a group of manuscripts from the Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar III of Mysore. Three people attempt to trap a tiger, and the tiger attempts to eat the people.")
        (rules "A triangle, with a point in the center and lines connecting it to the apex and the midpoints of the two sides which meet at the apex. One person plays as the tiger, which begins on the apex. The other person plays as three people. Players alternate turns, with the person playing as the people first placing a person on the board, and then the tiger moving to an empty adjacent spot along the lines of the board. When all of the people have been placed, the people move on the board in the same fashion. The tiger may capture one of the people by jumping over it to an empty adjacent spot immediately on the opposite side of one of the people along the lines of the board. The tiger wins when it captures one person, the people win when they can block the tiger from being able to move.")
