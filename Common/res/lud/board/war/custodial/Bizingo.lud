            A player captures an enemy captain by surrounding it on three sides, with the caveat that one of the surrounding pieces must be a captain. (Three regular pieces are insufficient and the enemy captain would be unaffected.)
            An enemy piece on the edge of the board can be captured by surrounding it on two sides, with the caveat that one of the surrounding pieces must be a captain. (Two regular pieces are insufficient.)
            If a piece (regular or captain) is moved to a cell already surrounded by three enemy pieces, it is instantly captured, unless the move itself performed a capture.
            
        A player wins the game by reducing the opponent to two pieces.")
