Hnefatafl appears to be related to a range of other tafl games, in which on side has a king and a smaller number of pawns, situated in the center of the board, playing against an opponent with more pieces. The king's goal is largely thought to be to escape to one of the corners, and the opponent's goal is to capture the king.")

                The attackers comprise 24 soldiers positioned in four groups of 6 around the perimeter of the board.
                The King piece is the only piece that can occupy the central and the four corner squares.
        All pieces move orthogonally any number of spaces, and pieces are taken by custodial capture (surrounding an enemy  piece on either side with two of a player's pieces). The king piece must be captured by surrounding it on all four sides."))
