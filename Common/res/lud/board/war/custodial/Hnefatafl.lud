Hnefatafl appears to be related to a range of other tafl games, in which on side has a king and a smaller number of pawns, situated in the center of the board, playing against an opponent with more pieces. The king's goal is largely thought to be to escape to one of the corners, and the opponent's goal is to capture the king.")

                Their objective is for the king to escape by reaching any of the four corner squares.
                The attackers comprise 24 soldiers positioned in four groups of 6 around the perimeter of the board.
                The King piece is the only piece that can occupy the central and the four corner squares.
        All pieces move orthogonally any number of spaces, and pieces are taken by custodial capture (surrounding an enemy  piece on either side with two of a player's pieces). The king piece must be captured by surrounding it on all four sides."))

Other pieces may move over the central square, but not land on it. Pieces are captures when surrounded on opposite sides by opposing pieces, or being surrounded by a marked square and an opposing piece. A row of pieces along the edge of the board may be captured by completely surrounding them along the edge so they cannot move. The king may be captured by surrounding it on all four sides. The king may also be captured by surrounding it on three sides and the central square on the fourth. The king wins the game by moving to one of the corner squares. The attackers win by capturing the king. The attackers may also win by surrounding all of the king's forces to they cannot reach the edge of the board.
