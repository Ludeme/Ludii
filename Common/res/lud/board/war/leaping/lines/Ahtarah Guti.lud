        (aliases {"Bazi Mar" "Tichha" "Bangala"})
        (rules "5x5 intersecting lines, with diagonals in each quadrant. Two triangles, the apexes of which intersect with the square at the midpoint of opposite sides. One line bisecting the base of the triangle, and another bisecting this line. Eighteen pieces per player, each side arranged on one side of the board, with the central point empty and the player's pieces on the points to the right of it. Players alternate turns moving one of their pieces to an empty point. A piece may jump an opponent's piece to capture it. Multiple captures are allowed. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
