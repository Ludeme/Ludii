        (rules "9x9 board played on the intersections, with diagonals for each 3x3 square. Typically played with 24 pieces, but any number up to 40 is possible. Pieces are arranged on the spots in the rows closest to the player, with those unable to fill a row placed on the right points of the next available row. Players alternate turns by moving a piece to an adjacent empty spot along the lines on the board. A player may capture an opponent's piece by hopping over one adjacent piece if there is an empty spot behind it along a line on the board. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
