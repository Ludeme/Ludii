        (description "Nei-Pat-Kono is a game played in Korea at least since the end of the nineteenth century, and likely earlier. It is a game of leaping captures similar to others common around the world.")
        (aliases {"Four Field Kono"})
        (rules "4x4 board, eight pieces each player. Pieces move orthogonally by either jumping a player's own piece to capture an opponent's piece or by moving one space into an empty hole. Captures are not compulsory. The goal is to reduce the opponents pieces to 1 or blocking them so they can no longer move.")
