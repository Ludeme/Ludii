        (description "Egara Guti was documented in India during the early twentieth century. It is similar to other games found in India which seem to be related to alquerque games on various board configurations. The board is laid out like a Lau Kata Kati board, but with the second lines of each triangle connected on each side.")
        (rules "Each player begins with their eleven pieces arrayed on the intersections of the lines in one of the triangles. Pieces move to an adjacent point along one of the lines connecting it to its present location. Captures are made by hopping over an opponent's piece. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
