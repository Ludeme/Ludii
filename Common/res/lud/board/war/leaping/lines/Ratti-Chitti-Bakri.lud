        (description "Ratti-Chitti-Bakri is a game with leaping captures played in India. Each player controls forty pieces on a 9x9 board. It is played in a similar way to several other games in South, Southeast, and West Asia.")
        (rules "9x9 board played on the intersections, with diagonals for each 3x3 square. Forty pieces per player, one playing as white, the other as red, arranged on opposite sides of the board, each player's pieces taking up the first through fourth ranks of spaces, plus their right half of the fifth rank. The central spot remains empty. Players alternate turns by moving a piece to an adjacent empty spot along the lines on the board. A player may capture an opponent's piece by hopping over one adjacent piece if there is an empty spot behind it along a line on the board. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
