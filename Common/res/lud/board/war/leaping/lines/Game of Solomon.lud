A piece can hop over an adjacent enemy piece to an empty point immeidately beyond it, forwards or sideways, and must do so if possible. Only one hope per turn is allowed. If a piece reaches the far point of the board, it is promoted to a king which can also move and hop backwards. Win by eliminating all enemy pieces. The game is drawn if both players are reduced to a single king.")
