        (rules "8x8 checkered board, the dark spaces placed so that the bottom right corner is a dark space. Twelve pieces per player, placed on the dark spaces of the first three rows closest to the players. Players alternate turns moving a piece forward diagonally to an empty space. Pieces may capture an opponent's piece by hopping over it to an empty adjacent space. Captures are compulsory, multiple captures are possible, the maximum capture possible is not required. When a piece reaches the opposite edge of the board from where it started, it stops moving (if in a capture sequence), becomes a king, and the turn ends. Kings may move any distance diagonally forward or backward, and may capture any number of opponent's pieces it leaps over. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.
