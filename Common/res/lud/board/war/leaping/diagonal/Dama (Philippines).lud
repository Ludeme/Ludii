Twelve pieces per player, positioned on the first three rows closest to the player. Players alternate turns moving a piece forward to an empty adjacent spot along the lines. A player may capture an opponent's piece by hopping over it to an empty spot on the opposite side of it along the lines. Multiple captures are allowed, if possible. When a player's piece reaches the opposite edge of the board from which it started, it becomes a king. Kings may move any distance diagonally forward or backward, and may capture any number of opponent's pieces it leaps over. The king cannot take in multiple directions in one turn. The first player to capture all of the opponent's pieces wins.
