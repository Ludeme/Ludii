When a piece reaches the opposite edge of the board from its starting position, it becomes a king and can may move and jump over any number of spaces diagonally. Captures are compulsory and the maximum number of jumps must be made. Winning is achieved by capturing all the opponent's pieces or by blocking them from moving.")
