        (rules "10x10 board. Twenty pieces per player, which begin on the four rows closest to the player. The row of pieces on the edge of the board closest to each player begins with the pieces already as Queens. Pieces move diagonally one space forward, or can jump an adjacent piece belonging to the opponent to capture it. Captures are mandatory, and the maximum number of captures possible must be taken. When pieces reach the opposite edge of the board from where they started, they are promoted to Queen. Queens move any number of spaces diagonally, and jump over any number of opponents' pieces over any distance. When a Queen reaches that edge of the board a second time (or, for the first time if one of those which began the game as a Queen), they are further promoted, gaining the power to move and take orthogonally over any distance. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.  ")
