        (rules "10x10  board. Twenty pieces per player, which begin in the four rows closest to the players. Pieces move diagonally forward one space. Pieces capture orthogonally or diagonally, in any direction, when there is one empty space between the piece and the opponent's piece, and an empty space immediately on the opposite side of the opponent's piece. Pieces are promoted to Queen when they reach the edge of the board opposite from where they start. Queens may capture orthogonally or diagonally in any direction over any distance, as long as there are no other pieces intervening and there is an empty spot immediately after the piece to be captured, which is where the Queen lands to make the capture. Multiple captures are allowed  for Queens and regular pieces. Queens move orthogonally or diagonally any distance. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
