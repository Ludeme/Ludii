When captured, a piece is placed underneath the capturing piece, creating columns. When columns are captured, only the piece at the top of the column is taken. Columns are controlled by the player whose piece is on top of the column. When a piece or column reaches the opposite side of the board they become promoted to officer and can move backwards. A player wins by capturing all of the opponent's pieces.")
