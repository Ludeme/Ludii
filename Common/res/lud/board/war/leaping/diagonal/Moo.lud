        (rules "8x8 board, every other square marked with an X in a checkered pattern. Twelve pieces per player, positioned on the first three rows closest to the player on the marked squares. Players alternate turns moving a piece diagonally forward. A player may capture an opponent's piece by hopping over it to an empty spot on the opposite side of it along the lines. Multiple captures are allowed, if possible. When a player's piece reaches the opposite edge of the board from which it started, it becomes a king. It may move over any distance, diagonally, and may capture by leaping any distance over any number of opponent's pieces, capturing all of them in that line. The king cannot take in multiple directions in one turn. The first player to capture all of the opponent's pieces wins.
