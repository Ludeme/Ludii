Anecdotally, it is said to have been invented by French settlers to Quebec, but 12x12 boards are known from Europe before this. Played on a 12x12 board with 30 pieces per player. Otherwise, follows the rules of International Draughts.")

        (rules "Played on a 12x12 board with 30 pieces per player, arranged on the dark squares. Pieces move diagonally one or can jump an opponent's adjacent player to capture it. Pieces can move forward or backwards. When a piece reaches the opposite edge of the board from its starting position, it becomes a king and can may move and jump over any number of spaces diagonally. Captures are compulsory and the maximum number of jumps must be made. Winning is achieved by capturing all the opponent's pieces or by blocking them from moving.")
