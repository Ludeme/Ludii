        (rules "8x8 board. Twelve pieces per player. Pieces move diagonally one space forward, and can capture opponent's pieces by jumping them in a forward direction if they are adjacent. Capturing must happen if it is possible. Multiple captures are allowed. Once pieces reach the opposite side of the board from their starting position, they become kings and can move diagonally either forwards or backwards, and can capture by jumping over any number of pieces, any distance. The goal is to capture all of the opponent's pieces.")
