        (rules "10x10 checkered board. Twenty pieces per player, arranged on the four rows closest to the player. Pieces move orthogonally or diagonally in any direction, only on the white spaces. Pieces may capture by jumping over an enemy piece to an empty space on the other side of it. Multiple captures in one turn are allowed. The player to capture all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
