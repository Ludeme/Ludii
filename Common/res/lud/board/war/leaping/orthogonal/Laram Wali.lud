Three squares in each arm with six pieces per player is common. Players alternate turns placing pieces on the board. Players may not place pieces in the central space. When the pieces are placed, players alternate turns move a piece to am empty adjacent square, or hopping over an adjacent opponent's piece or an unbroken line of opponent's pieces with an empty space behind it. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.
