Pieces move orthogonally in a horizontal or forward direction only. To capture, a piece may jump over an adjacent opponent's piece to an empty spot immediately on the opposite side of the piece along the lines of the board. Pieces may capture in a backwards direction. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
