Pieces begin the game on the first two rows in front of the player, and in the two squares to the player's right in the central row. Players alternate turns moving a piece orthogonally to an adjacent empty space. Players may capture an opponent's piece by hopping over it. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
