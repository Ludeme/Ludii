Players alternate turns moving a piece to an adjacent orthogonal space. The player may capture an opponent's piece by hopping over it in an orthogonal direction. Multiple hops are allowed in the same turn, but captures are not compulsory, The player who captures all of their opponent's pieces wins.")
