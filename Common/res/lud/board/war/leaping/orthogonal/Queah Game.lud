        (description "The Queah Game is a game from nineteenth century Liberia, the name of which has not been reported. It is typically played in a \"board\" of interwoven sticks, in which \"male\" and \"female\" sticks are placed as pieces.")
        (rules "Played on a board with two rows of five spaces forming an \"X,\" with an extra space diagonally adjacent to the central space. Ten sticks per player. Each player begins with one stick in each of the rightmost four spaces on the edge of the board closest to them. Players alternate turns moving a stick to an adjacent space. A player may capture one of the opponent's sticks by jumping over it to an empty space beyond it. The opponent replaces the captured stick with one of those remaining in their reserve, until there are no sticks remaining. The player who captures all of the opponent's sticks wins. ")
