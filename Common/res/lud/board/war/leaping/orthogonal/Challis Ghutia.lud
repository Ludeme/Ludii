Players alternate turns moving pieces to an empty adjacent spot along the lines. A piece may capture an opponent's piece by hopping over it to the empty spot immediately on the opposite side of it, following the lines of the board. Multiple captures are allowed. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
