            Piece Movement:
            * All pieces other than Pawns move as in Glinski Chess.
            - Kings step one space in any of the 12 directions. They do not castle.
            - Queens slide in any of the 12 directions.
            - Rooks slide in any of the 6 adjacent direction.
            - Bishops slide in any of the 6 'diagonal' directions.
            - Knights move two spaces in any adjacent direction, then one space in another direction.
            * Pawns can advance one space forward without capturing. A Pawn on a Pawn start space but not in the innermost column can advance two spaces forward without capturing. Pawns capture 'diagonally forward' (i.e., to a space ahead connected by an edge, and having the same colour). En Passant capture and Pawn promotion take place as in Glinski Chess.
            
        The game ends on a checkmate or stalemate.")
