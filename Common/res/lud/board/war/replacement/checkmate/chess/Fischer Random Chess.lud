White's pieces (not pawns) are placed randomly on the first rank, following two rules: The bishops must be placed on opposite-color squares. The king must be placed on a square between the rooks. Black's pieces are placed equal-and-opposite to White's pieces. (For example, if the white king is randomly determined to start on f1, then the black king is placed on f8.) Pawns are placed on the players' second ranks as in classical chess. After setup, the game is played the same as classical chess in all respects.")
