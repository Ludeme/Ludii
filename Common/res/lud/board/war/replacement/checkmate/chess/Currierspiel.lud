Only the Rooks' and Queens' pawns may move forward two spaces for their first move. Each player must move the Rooks' Pawns and Queens' Pawn in this way in their first three moves. A piece is captured when an opponent's piece moves onto its space. The King is in check when it can be taken on the opponent's next turn; it must not remain in check at the end of the player's turn. When the king cannot move out of check, it is checkmated and the opponent wins.")
