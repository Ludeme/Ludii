        (rules "8x8 board. The pieces move as follows, with the number per player: 1 x King (king): moves one space orthogonally or diagonally. The King may leap to the second or third square on its first move, or move as a Knight, and does not hop over an opponent's piece. The King also cannot capture with this move. 1 x Queen: One square diagonally. On its first move, the Queen may jump diagonally two squares. The Queen cannot capture when making this move. 2 x Rook: Any number of spaces orthogonally. 2 x Bishop: Two squares diagonally, jumping over the first. Cannot capture another Bishop. 2 x Knight: Moves one space orthogonally and then one space diagonally, jumping over any intervening pieces. 8 x Pawn: Moves one space forward orthogonally; one space forward diagonally to capture. May move two spaces on its first move. En passant is not allowed. Promoted to Queen when reaching the eighth rank, and may make the Queen's leap on its first move after being promoted. If this promotion is made with the opponent's King at the distance of the extended move, it does not give check on that turn. No castling. An opponent's piece is captured by moving a player's own piece onto a space occupied by the opponent's piece. When a King can be captured on the next turn by an opponent's piece, it is in check. The King must not be in check at the end of the player's turn. If this is not possible, it is checkmate and the opponent wins. Stalemate results in a draw.
