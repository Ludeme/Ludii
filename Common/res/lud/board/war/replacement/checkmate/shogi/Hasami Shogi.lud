(description "Hasami Shogi is a simplified version of Shogi, a Japanese game which is ultimately related to the Indian game Chaturanga. It is played only with the pawns on a 9x9 Shogi board.")
(rules "Play begins with the pieces arranged in the last row of squares on opposite sides of the board. Pieces move as rooks in Chess. An opponent's piece is captured by surrounding it on two opposite sides by a player's piece. Play continues until all but one player's pieces are captured.")
