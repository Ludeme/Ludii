Two courtiers: Move one space diagonally and cannot leave the palace. One general: Moves on space orthogonally and cannot leave the palace. Two elephants: Move two spaces diagonally and cannot cross the river. One chariot: can move any distance orthogonally, taking either by jumping or by landing on the same space, and can also move like a knight in chess. The player that checkmates the other player's general wins.")
