        (rules "Played on a board with 9x10 intersecting lines. Pieces are placed on the intersections of the lines. Centered on opposite sides of the boards are two areas, known as the gong (\"castle\"). Bisecting the board is a blank space known as the he (\"river\"). Pieces are double-sided, with different colors and names of the pieces indicating to which player they belong. Jiang(\"general\")/shuai(\"marshal\")(1): may move one space orthogonally and cannot leave the gong except when opposite the opponent's jiang/shuai, in which case the piece can capture the opponent's jiang/shuai. Shi(\"guard\")(2): moves one space diagonally and cannot leave the gong. Xiang(\"elephant\")/xiang(\"minister\")(2): move two places diagonally and cannot cross the river. Ma(\"horse\")(2): move orthogonally one and then diagonally one space. Can be blocked by a piece next to it orthogonally. Ju(\"chariot\"(2): moves any number of spaces orthogonally. Pao(\"catapult\")/pao(\"cannon\") (2): can move orthogonally any number of spaces, captures by jumping one piece (of either player). Zu(\"private\"/zu(\"soldier\")(5): can move one space forward. Once they cross the river, can also move one space horizontally. The goal is to checkmate the opponent's jiang/shuai.")
