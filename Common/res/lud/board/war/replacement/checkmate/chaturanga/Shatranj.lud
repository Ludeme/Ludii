        (description "Shatranj is a game derived from Chaturanga which probably began in Iran and spread throughout the Islamic world and into Europe. It is the game from which Chess directly evolved into its modern form, though Shatranj was known as \"Chess\" in Europe when it was adopted there.")

        (rules "8x8 board. The pieces move as follows, with the number per player: 1 x Shah (king): moves one space orthogonally or diagonally. 1 x Fers (counselor): One square diagonally. 2 x Rukh (rook): Any number of spaces orthogonally. 2 x Pil (elephant): Two squares diagonally, jumping over the first. Cannot capture another Pil. 2 x Asb (horse): Moves as a chess knight. 8 x Sarbaz (soldier): Moves one space forward orthogonally; one space forward diagonally to capture. No en passant. Promoted to Fers when reaching the eighth rank. No castling. Stalemate results in win for player causing it. The player who checkmates the king wins.")
