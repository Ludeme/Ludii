It is first documented in India, and the pieces (infantry, horses, elephants, and chariots) reflect the four divisions of the Indian army, who protect the counselor and king. Various Indian texts discuss the rules and problems, and it is also a popular theme in Indian art and literature.")

These are set up along one edge of the board: Ratha-Ashva-Gaja-Mantri-Raja-Gaja-Ashva-Ratha, with the eight Bhata lined up in the row in front of these, as in chess. Players take turns moving. When one piece lands on the space occupied by another piece, it is captured. Play continues until one player's king cannot move without being captured."))
