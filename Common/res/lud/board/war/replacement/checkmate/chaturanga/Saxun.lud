The pieces move as follows: Álix' (\"old man\"), x1: moves one space orthogonally or diagonally; Férsix' (\"fers\"), x1: moves any number of spaces orthogonally or diagonally; Lúdkax' (\"boat\"), x2: moves orthogonally any number of spaces; Slúnax' (\"elephant\"), x2: moves diagonally any number of spaces; Kúnax' (\"horse\"), x2: moves like a Chess knight; Layakúcan (\"little boys\"), x8: move forward one space, capture diagonally forward. Captures are made when a piece moves onto a space occupied by an opponent's piece. A player's Álix' is checked when it can be taken by the opponent on their next turn, and this possibility must be removed before the opponent plays. If a player's Álix' is checkmated, the opponent wins. ")
