        (rules "8x8 board. Pieces have specific moves, as follows: Mai (x1): moves one space in any direction; Chiroma (x1): Moves one space diagonally; Bintu (x2): moves exactly two spaces diagonally, jumping over the first square; Fer (x2): moves orthogonally one space and then diagonally another space, jumping over any intervening pieces; Kaigamma (x2): moves orthogonally any distance; Gollo: (x8) move one space forward orthogonally, or one space diagonally forward to capture. Pieces capture the opponent's pieces by moving onto the spot they occupy. No en passant; no castling. When the Mai can be captured at the beginning of the opponent's next turn, it is in check and must be removed from this state on the player's turn. If this is not possible, it is checkmate and the player who threatened the Mai wins. ")
