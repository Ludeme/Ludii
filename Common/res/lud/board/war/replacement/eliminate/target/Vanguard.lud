            Each player starts with 3 outriders, 1 ram, 1 captain, and 1 flag.
            
            Capture by moving onto an opponent's piece. Only the captain can capture an opponent's ram.
            
            -Outriders move 1 space orthogonally or diagonally.
            
            -The captain moves one space orthogonally. When a player moves their captain, their flag automatically moves onto the space their captain last occupied; this counts as one move.
            
            -The ram moves 3 spaces in a straight line orthogonally in the opposite direction of an adjacent friendly piece. The ram stops if it captures an enemy piece, is blocked by a friendly piece or opponent's ram, enters a corner space, or enters an edge space while moving directly east or west. If the ram enters an edge space while moving northwards/southwards and has moved less than 3 spaces, it 'bounces' by changing direction to the other remaining northwards/southwards direction that does not lead off the board. Likewise, the same rule applies if the ram initiates a move while occupying an edge space with an adjacent friendly piece to the north or south.
            
        If a player captures the opponent's flag, they win. If a player has no legal moves, they lose.")
