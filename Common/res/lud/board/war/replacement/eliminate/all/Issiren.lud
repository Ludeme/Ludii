The value of the throws equals the number of green faces, with the following exceptions: four green faces up allows a piece to be moved for the first time and a move of 1, plus another throw is granted; six white faces = 4 plus another throw; six green = 6 plus another throw; five white faces = move 5 plus another throw. Pieces move from right to left in the player's home row, then into the second row, moving left to right, then into the third row moving right to left, and then into the opponent's home row moving left to right, then back into the third row moving right to left, to the second row moving left to right, and then back into the player's home row moving right to left. If a player's piece lands on a space occupied by one of the opponent's pieces, the opponent's piece is captured. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
