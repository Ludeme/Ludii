Players alternate turns moving one of their pieces forward, diagonally, or horizontally on the board. When a player's piece is next to an opponent's piece with an empty space immediately on the opposite side of it, the player's piece may hop over the opponent's piece to capture it. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
