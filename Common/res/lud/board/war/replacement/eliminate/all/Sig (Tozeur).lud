Play progresses from left to right in the player's home row, and then from right to left in the second row, left to right in the third row, and then right to left in the opponent's row. A throw of 1 is required for each piece to being moving it. When a player's piece lands on a space occupied by a piece belonging to the opponent, the opponent's piece is captured. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins. ")
