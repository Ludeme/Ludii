        (description "Mehen is a game dating to the late fourth millennium through the end of the third millennium in Egypt. It takes the form of a coiled snake that is segmented into spaces, and the board varies in the number of spaces that appear on it. According to a tomb painting from the Tomb of Hesy-Re, there could be up to six players, each playing with a set of six spherical pieces and one lion-shaped piece. Tomb reliefs also show four players playing mehen in some cases. Mehen was also played outside of Egypt, particularly in Cyprus and certain parts of the Levant, and was played in Cyprus for at least 1000 years after it became unpopular in Egypt.")

                Four throwing sticks as dice.
                Players enter their spherical pieces on the board with a throw of one. They then race to the center
                of the spiral. The central space must be reached with an exact throw. To leave the central space,
                the player must throw two ones. The player then races in the opposite direction to leave the
                board.
                When a piece leaves the board, that player introduces a lion piece, that player being the only one
                to introduce lion pieces. The player introduces more lions with each piece this player moves off the board.
        The lion races to the central spot, doubling the number of the throws. The lion attempts to capture the other player's pieces by landing on them."))
