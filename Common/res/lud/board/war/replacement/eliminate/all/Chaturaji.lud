The king moves one square in any direction. Pawns move one square forward, and capture one square forward diagonally. Horses move three squares diagonally. Ships move two squares diagonally. The Elephant moves any number of squares orthogonally. Moves are determined by dice roll: 5= pawn or king, 4= elephant, 3= horse, 2= ship. Captures are made by moving onto the space occupied by an opponent's piece. If a ship moves into a space to make a 2x2 square with only ships, it captures the other three ships. Pawns may promote but only to the other piece that begins in that rank or file, including a king, and that piece must have already been captured. Points are awarded based on captures: pawns=1, ships=2, horses=3, elephants=4, kings=5. If a player captures their opponents' three kings while theirs remains, they receive 54 points. The player who accumulates the most points wins. "))
