        (rules "Seven players. Heptagonal board, with seven semi-circular socket as spaces on each side. Seven pieces per player, which begin on the leftmost spot on their side. Players are as follows: Saturn = black; Jupiter = green; Mars = red; the sun = yellow; Venus = purple; Mercury = multi-colored; the moon is white. Pieces move in an anti-clockwise direction around the board. Three seven-sided die. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the value on one die then another piece the value on the other die, or by moving one piece the value of one die and then the value of the other. When a piece lands on a space with a single piece belonging to an opponent, the opponent's piece is removed from the board. Play continues until one player remains, who becomes the winner.")
