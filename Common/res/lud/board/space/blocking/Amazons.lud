        (rules "Played on a 10x10 board. Each player has four Amazons (chess queens), with other pieces used as arrows. Two things happen on a turn: an amazon moves like a Chess queen, but cannot cross or enter a space occupied by another amazon or arrow. Then, it shoots an arrow to any space on the board that is along the path of a queen's move from that place. The last player able to make a move wins.")
