        (rules "A square, with diagonals, but one side of the square has been removed. Two pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing a piece on an empty spot on the board. When the pieces are placed, players alternate turns moving one of their pieces to an empty adjacent spot along the lines. The player who blocks the other from being able to move wins.")
