        (description "Pippinzip is a square-board connection game for two players.  This is the 'Pipline' variant, the standard version of the game.  The game starts with a chicken ballot phase similar to Unlur, in which players both place 1-3 Black stones per turn until one decides to pass their turn and take Black.  Subsequently, the players place one stone per turn of their colour on any empty point.  The Black player ('Pip') wins if they connect any two sides of the board with a single orthogonally-connected group of stones.  The White player ('Zip') wins if they connect all four sides of the board with a single group connected both orthogonally and diagonally.")
        (rules "This game is played on a square grid board of any size, though 13x13 or 19x19 are recommended. Then the players take it in turns to place 1-3 black stones each turn until one decides to pass; that player then becomes Black, and the other becomes White.  After that, players take it in turns to place one stone of their colour on the board on any empty point.  If Black connects any two sides of the board with a single orthogonally-connected group, they win; White wins if they connect all four sides with a group connected either orthogonally or diagonally.

        During the initial chicken ballot phase, you may add stones by clicking on available spaces, or skip the rest of your placements (by choosing the Next Player action).  Alternatively, you may Pass at the start of your turn to take Black.  After that, you and your opponent will alternate playing one stone of your colour per turn, until one player forms a connection (draws are impossible in Pippinzip).")
