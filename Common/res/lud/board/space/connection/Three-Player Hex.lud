        (rules "Three-Player Hex is played on the Hex board, typically with five cells per side. As in standard Hex, players take turn placing a piece of their color on an empty cell, and the first player to connect the opposite sides of the board marked his color with a chain of his pieces wins. As soon as it it no longer possible for a player to connect his edges, that player is eliminated from the game and may not place any more stones.")
