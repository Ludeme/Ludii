        (rules "The rules of TRAX are simple:
            - Place tiles adjacent to those already in play such that the colours of the tracks match.
            - The objective is to get a loop or line of your colour while attempting to stop your opponent in their colour.
            - A line is a continuous path of track that connects opposite and outermost edges of the tiles in play, over at least 8 rows of tiles, across or down.
            - What gives Trax its strategic depth is the forced play rule which allows (or even requires) multiple tiles to be played in a turn.
