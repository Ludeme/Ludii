        (aliases {"Othello"})
        (rules "Reversi is played on an 8x8 board. Pieces are double-sided, with each side distinct in some way from the other. Each side designates ownership of that pieces to a certain player when face-up. Play begins with the players taking turns placing pieces into the central four squares until they are full. Then players may place their pieces next to an opponent's piece, a long as a straight line can be drawn between the new piece and an existing piece belonging to that player that goes through the opponent's piece. The opponent's pieces between the new piece and the old piece are then flipped and now belong to the player who just played. If a player cannot make a legal move, they pass. Play continues until the board is full or neither player cannot make a legal move. The player with the most pieces on the board wins.")
