        (description "Rolit is an easy to learn strategy game that’s fun for the whole family. The aim of the game is to capture your opponent’s Rolit balls and turn balls to make them your color. The player with the most Rolit balls of their color wins!")
        (rules "This is basically 4-player Othello, albeit more \"friendly\", since you can place a piece of your color even if you have none on the board. It features unique ball-shaped objects that have four colors. You \"roll\" them to the proper color when converting them, as opposed to flipping in 2-player Othello. The game adds a higher chaos factor in the 3 and 4 player game since you don't have any control over what your opponents do.")
