From an early date, it spread from China to Japan and Korea, and more recently it has become a popular game worldwide. It is a game of configuration, where the goal is to gain points by controlling territory on the board. ")

Players alternate turns placing a piece on the board. A player may pass at any time. A piece or a group of pieces are captured when they are completely surrounded on all sides on adjacent intersections by the opposing player. Stones cannot be placed to recreate a previous position. The game ends when both players pass consecutively. Players total the number of intersections their pieces occupy or surround. The player with the highest total wins. ")
