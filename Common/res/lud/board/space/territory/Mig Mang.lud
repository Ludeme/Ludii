        (rules "17x17 intersecting lines. 151 pieces per player. Each player begins with six larger pieces on the board, on the third line from the perimeter on all four sides, one piece on every fourth intersection, alternating between black and white. These pieces are never moved from the  board. There is a star marking at each of these points. Players alternate turns placing one of their pieces on an empty intersection of the board. When a player encloses an area with their pieces, it becomes their territory, and any pieces of the opponent inside it are captured. The opponent cannot place one of their pieces inside a territory won on the previous turn. White plays first. When players can no longer play, the number of  counters and each territory are counted to determine the winner.")
