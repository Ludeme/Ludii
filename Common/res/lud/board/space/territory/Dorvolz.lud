// Comment: That game is built in following the rules describing in the source; however that's not possible to reach a terminal state with its current
// implementation. That's why we are thinking it should be impossible to place sites enclosed by your pieces and the game should stop when its impossible to play for the mover.

Each player has two kinds of piece, six bull-shaped pieces and 144 round pieces. To begin, players place their bull-shaped pieces on the opposite-color marked points on the board. Then, players alternate turns placing one of their pieces in an adjacent space next to one of their bull pieces. Once all of the bull pieces have been surrounded, the main phase of play begins. Players alternate turns placing one of their pieces on the board. The player who encloses the greatest number of empty spaces wins.")
