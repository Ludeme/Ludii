        (rules "Two players, White and Black, take turns placing a piece of their colour on an empty board hole or stacked on four pieces. Any group with no freedom (adjacent empty board hole) is captured and removed, except that balls that support other balls are not removed. Other Go rules apply, except that passing is not allowed. The game ends when a player has no legal moves. The player with the most marbles in play wins.")
