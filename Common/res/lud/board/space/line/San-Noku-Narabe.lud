        (rules "3x3 intersecting lines. Three pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing a piece on an empty spot on the board. Once all of the pieces are placed, players move a piece to any empty spot on the board. The first player to make an orthogonal row of three along the lines of the board wins.")
