Once all of the sticks have been placed, the players may move their sticks orthogonally one space. If a player can bring three of their sticks in a row, they may then remove one of the opponent's sticks during either phase of the game. During the movement phase, if a player has a row of four pieces and moves one away, leaving a row of three spaces, this also allows the player to capture an opponent's piece. The player who can no longer play loses.")
