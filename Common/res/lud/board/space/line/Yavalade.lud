Black player takes a white piece and places a black piece on top of it, placing the stack before them. Red player takes a black piece and places a red piece on top of it, placing the stack before them. Starting with White, players take turns placing a piece of their colour on an empty space of the board until the victory condition is reached. The aim of the game is to create a 5-in-a-row containing both and only both colours of your stack.")
