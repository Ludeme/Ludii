        (rules "3x3 intersecting lines with diagonals. Play occurs on the intersections of the lines. Three pieces per player. Play begins with each player placing pieces on empty points. If they make three in a row along the lines, they win. Once all pieces are place, players take turns moving pieces one spot to an adjacent point along the lines trying to make three in a row.
