            Play: White starts by placing a white stone at an empty cell. Players then take turns placing two stones of their color at empty cells, one stone after another.
            
            In each placement, players are not allowed to create a single
            4-in-a-row of their color, unless that placement simultaneously
            creates at least one other 4-in-a-row of their color to win the game.
            
            This means that players may NOT make a single 4-in-a-row of their color on the first placement of their turn even if they can make a second 4-in-a-row on their second placement.
            
            In no event are players allowed to create 5 (or more) -in-a-row of their color.
            
        The first player to make simultaneous 4-in-a-rows of their color wins immediately, whether it was their first or second placement.")
