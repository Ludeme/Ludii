They take turns placing pieces on an empty board.Once all pieces are placed, players can move pieces orthogonally to an adjacent space, attempting to make three in a row. When three in a row are made, an opponent's piece is removed from the board that is not in a three in a row pattern. Placing more than three in a row is not allowed. Three in a row during the initial phase of the game does not count. When a player has only two pieces left, they lose.")
