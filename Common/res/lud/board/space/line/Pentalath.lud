        (description "Pentalath was invented by Cameron Browne in 2009. It is a connection game with the goal of creating a group of five in a row, but with complications.")
        (rules "The board starts empty. White plays first. Players take turns placing a piece of their colour on an empty cell. Passing is not allowed. After each move, the opponent's pieces with no freedom are captured and removed from the board. A piece has freedom if the group it belongs to touches an empty cell. It is not allowed to place a piece in a space without freedom, unless that move captures the other player's pieces to create freedom. The game ends when one of the players wins a game by making a line of five (or more) stones of their colour.")
