        (description "Xonin Shatar (Sheep Chess) is a game of alignment played in Mongolia. ")
        (rules "Three concentric squares, with lines connecting the corners and the midpoints of the sides. Twelve pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing a piece on an empty spot on the board. When all of the pieces have been placed, players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent spot along the lines. During either phase, when a player places three of their pieces in a row, they remove one of the opponent's pieces. Pieces which are in a three-in-a-row pattern cannot be removed from the board. The player who removes all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
