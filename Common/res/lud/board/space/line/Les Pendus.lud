        (description "Les Pendus is a game of alignment from France. It comes in a three-in-a-row variant and a five-in-a-row variant. It is unknown how old these games are in France, but the boards on which they are played have been common since the Roman (three-in-a-row) or medieval (five-in-a-row) period.")
