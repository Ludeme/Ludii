        (rules "The game starts with the board empty. Order plays first, then turns alternate. On each turn, a player places either an X or an O on any open square. Order aims to get five like pieces in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Chaos aims to fill the board without completion of a line of five like pieces.")
