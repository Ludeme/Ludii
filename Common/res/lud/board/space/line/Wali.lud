Players alternate turns placing one of their pieces on an empty space on the board. Players are not permitted to place more than two of their own pieces in an orthogonal row on the board. When all of the pieces are placed, players alternate turns moving one of their pieces orthogonally one space. When a player successfully places three of their pieces in an orthogonal row of three, the player captures one of the opponent's pieces. The player who captures all of their opponent's pieces wins.")
