            SHIFT - Instead of dropping a stone, the player may decide to shift one row or column, one cell left/right (for rows) or up/down (for columns). 
            All stones are shifted on the chosen direction. If a stone is shifted off-board, it is placed on the other end of the shifted row/column (so, for shift purposes, the board is a Torus).
            KO rule- If a player has just shifted, the next player cannot shift that row/column.
            
        GOAL - A player wins when he makes a 5 in-a-row (orthogonal or diagonal). If a shift give both players a 5 in-a-row, wins the player that made that shift.")
