        (rules "5x6 or 6x6 board. Twelve pieces per player. Players take turns placing pieces on the board. Once all the pieces are on the board, players may move one piece orthogonally one space during their turn. Players cannot create a line of more than three in an orthogonal direction, and cannot make a line of three during the placement phase. If three pieces are in an orthogonal line, they cannot be moved again. If a player makes three rows before the opponent makes one, it is an automatic win.
