The red player plays first and places their piece in the central spot. Players alternate turns placing one of their pieces on an empty space on the board. When all of the pieces are placed, players alternate turns moving one of their pieces to an empty adjacent spot on the board along the lines. The first player to place three of their pieces in a row wins.")
