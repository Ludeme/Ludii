        (rules "3x3 intersecting lines with diagonals. Play occurs on the intersections of the lines. Players each have three pieces, initially placed on the sides closest to the player. Players move the pieces to an adjacent unoccupied intersection along the lines. The goal is to make three in a row which cannot be in the starting position. An alternate version requires the three in a row to be diagonal.")
