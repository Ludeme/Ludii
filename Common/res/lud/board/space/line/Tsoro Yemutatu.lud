        (description "Tsoro Yemutatu is an alignment game from Zimbabwe. This version, played on a square board, is played by boys and young men, but sometimes adults and is usually scratched on the ground and played with stones.")
        (rules "3x3 intersecting lines, with diagonals drawn in the large square. Three pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing a stone on an empty point on the board. When all of the pieces have been placed, players alternate turns moving one of their pieces to any empty point. The first player to place three of their pieces in a line wins.
