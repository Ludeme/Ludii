Play occurs on the intersections of the lines and the corners of the squares. Each player has five pieces. Play begins with each player placing pieces on empty points. If they make three in a row along the lines, they can remove one of the opponent's pieces. Once all pieces are place, players take turns moving pieces one spot to an adjacent point along the lines. If a player makes three in a row, an opponent's piece is removed as in the first phase of the game. The game is won when the opponent is reduced to two pieces."))
