(rules "Two triangles, which form a six-pointed star, with lines connecting the corner of one triangle with the corner of the other triangle which is opposite it. Nine pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing a piece on an empty point on the board. Players cannot place a piece in the central point during this phase. When all of the pieces are placed, players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent point on the board. During either phase, when a player places three of their pieces in a row, they remove one of the opponent's pieces. When three pieces are in a three-in-a-row pattern, they cannot be removed. The player who removes all of the opponent's pieces from the board wins.")
