        (rules "7x6 board. Eighteen pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing a piece on the board. When all of the pieces have been placed, players alternate turns moving a piece to an adjacent empty square in an orthogonal direction. When a player places three of their pieces in an orthogonal line, they capture one of the opponent's pieces. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
