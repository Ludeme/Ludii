They are forbidden from placing two of their own pieces orthogonally adjacent to one another. Once all of the pieces are placed, players alternate turns moving the pieces in an orthogonal direction to an empty adjacent spot. When they place a piece so that two are in a row, they capture one of the opponent's pieces. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
