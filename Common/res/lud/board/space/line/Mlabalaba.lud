In the first phase, players take turns placing pieces on an empty spot on the board. If they place three pieces so they are in a line, forming a \"meul.\" they remove one of the opponent's pieces that is not in a \"meul.\" Once all the pieces are placed, the second phase begins, in which players take turns moving one piece to an adjacent empty spot. When a \"meul\" is formed, the player removes one of the opponent's pieces that is not in a \"meul.\" When one player is reduced to three pieces, they may move their pieces to any empty spot on the board. The player who reduces their opponent to two pieces wins.
