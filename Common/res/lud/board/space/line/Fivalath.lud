        (description "Fivalath is a game invented by Néstor Romeral Andrés in 2020 that was inspired by Yavalath.  Players must make a line of five of their pieces to win, but will lose if they make a line of 4 first.")
        (rules "Played on a square grid (8x8 or larger) with two players. Players alternate placing one stone of their colour on the board on any empty point.  If a player makes a line of five pieces, either orthogonally or diagonally, they win; but if they make a line of four pieces, they lose.")
