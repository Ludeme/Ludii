        (rules "Triangle, with a line from the apex bisecting the base, and a line bisecting this one and the opposite sides. Three pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing a piece on one of the empty points on the board. When all of the pieces have been placed, players alternate turns moving any one of their pieces to the empty point on the board. The first player to make a line of three wins. ")
