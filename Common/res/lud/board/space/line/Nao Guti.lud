(description "Nao Guti is a game of alignment played in South Asia, with nine pieces on a board that is widely used throughout the world.")
(rules "Three concentric squares, with lines connecting the midpoints. Nine pieces per player. Players alternate turns placing a piece on the board on an empty spot. When all of the pieces have been placed, the players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent spot along the lines of the board. During either phase, if a player places three of their pieces in a row along the lines on the board, the player removes one of the opponent's pieces. The player who removes all of the opponent's peices wins.")
