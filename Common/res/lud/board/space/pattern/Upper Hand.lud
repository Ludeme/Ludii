After the placement of each marble, check to see if a square or marbles have been formed. If at least 3 of the 4 marbles that form a square are of the same color, a piece of that color go on top of that square. If as a result other squares are formed, the same rule is applied. The winner is the first player to have at least 27 marbles of his colour on the board.
