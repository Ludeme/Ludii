        (description "Hermit is a game in which players place stones on empty vertices to create connected groups of sizes 1, 3 and 5.                            It is easy to learn but challenging to master. Although the game is static (pieces do not move),  there is still a dynamic effect because legal placements turn on and off!                            Hermit can be played on the nodes of any graph, even on a four-dimensional tesseract! Twelve 2-dimensional graphs are included. Some graph require a neutral token to prevent symmetric play by the second player.")
        (rules "Hermit is a two player abstract game in which players drop stones to create edgewise connected, owned groups of odd sizes 1, 3 and 5 exclusively. 
            The game ends when neither player can legally place a stone. 
            The player with the most groups on the board at game's end wins. 
            Ties are broken by the most groups of size 1 (hermits), then by the most groups of size 3, and finally, the last player to place a stone wins.
            
            Scores are formatted 'aa1133', where aa = count of all groups, 11 = count of size 1 groups, and 33 = count of size 3 groups.
            
        It is helpful to turn on 'Show Legal Moves' (Alt-M).")
