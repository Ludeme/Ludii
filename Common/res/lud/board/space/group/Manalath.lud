        (description "Manalath was invented in 2012 by Dieter Stein and Néstor Romeral Andrés. It is a Yavalath-like game in which the players must create a group of five without first making a group of four.")
        (rules "Players take turns placing pieces of any colour. They can't  create groups of more than five pieces which are adjacent to each other.

            A group of 4 pieces is called a quart. A group of 5 pieces is called a quint.

            Players win if they finish their turn with a friendly quint, but lose if they finish their turn with a friendly quart on the board.

            Note: The winning and losing conditions for a player are checked after their move, only on their own turn.

        An end condition (win or loss) is effective when it occurred first and cannot be averted.")
