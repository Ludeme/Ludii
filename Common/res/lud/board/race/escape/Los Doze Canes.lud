Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the value on one die then another piece the value on the other die, or by moving one piece the value of one die and then the value of the other. Each player enters their pieces into their home section of the board (to the left of one player, to the right of the other player, and move pieces along a horseshoe-shaped track around the board toward the other player's home space. At the beginning of play, the first player will choose one quadrant of the board, and the goal of the game will be for one player to move two  pieces onto each of the six places in that quadrant. When a piece lands on a space occupied by a single piece of the opponent, the opponent's piece is removed from the board, and must be reentered.")
