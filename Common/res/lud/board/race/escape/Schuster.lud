        (rules "Played on a board with twelve points on either side. The points form a continuous track in a horseshoe shape; each player progresses in opposite directions (one from their bottom right to the top right, the other from their bottom left to their top left. Each player has 15 pieces. Each player's pieces begin in three stacks of five on the first point of their track. Two six-sided dice. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the value on one die then another piece the value on the other die, or by moving one piece the value of one die and then the value of the other. If a player places all of their pieces on all of the points on the final six points of their side of the board, with three on each of the final three points, they win two points. Otherwise, they move into the opposite side of the board. When an opponent's piece lands on a point occupied by one of the player's pieces on the opponent's side of the board, the piece is removed from the board and must enter again. A player's pieces cannot be hit on their own side of the board. Once a player has brought all of their pieces into the final six points of the board, they may begin to bear off. They can do so by rolling a 6 to move from the 6th point, and so on down to 1. Players must use all available moves presented by the dice. The first player to remove all of their pieces wins.
