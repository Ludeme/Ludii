        (rules "Four players. Circular board, with 24 semi-circular sockets along the circumference, divided into four sections of six. Twelve pieces per player; the player's colors are green, red, black, and white, the sections to which they enter are in that order anti-clockwise around the board. Three seven-sided dice. Play proceeds in an anti-clockwise fashion around the board, as is the order of player turns. Players enter their pieces on the board according to the throws of the dice. The player must enter all of their pieces, and then attempt to move all of their pieces in the section of the board belonging to the player sitting opposite them. Once the player achieves this, they begin bearing their pieces off the board. When a piece lands on a spot occupied by a single piece belonging to the opponent, the opponent's piece is returned to the place where it started. When a player bears off all their pieces, they win.")
