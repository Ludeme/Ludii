Each player moves their pieces in an anti-clockwise direction. Two six-sided dice. When a player rolls two 1s, they lose a piece. When a player rolls doubles of another number, the player may move two pieces the full total of the roll, or one piece only moves half the total roll. When consecutive numbers are rolled, the player may move one piece the total of the two dice and the second piece the value of the lower die, or may move one piece the total of the die and another piece the total of the dice minus 1. When the roll is two non-consecutive numbers, the player moves the values of the individual dice. The first player to move their pieces around the board and back to the starting position wins. ")
