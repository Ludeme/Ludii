        (rules "2x12 board, divided in half, where the spaces are rendered as points. Fifteen pieces per player. Two six-sided dice. Both players begin on the same side of the board, one player with fifteen pieces on the rightmost point, the other player with fourteen pieces on the point behind it, and one on the point behind that. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the value on one die then another piece the value on the other die, or by moving one piece the value of one die and then the value of the other. On each throw the player also plays a throw of 6 in addition to the throw presented by the dice. Pieces move in an anti-clockwise direction around the board. A piece cannot move to a point that is occupied by more than one of the opponent's pieces. If a piece lands on a point occupied by a single piece belonging  to the opponent, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and must enter again from the leftmost point in the row where the pieces began. A piece may be borne off the board when a throw is greater than the number of points left on the board. The first player to bear all of their pieces off the board wins.")
