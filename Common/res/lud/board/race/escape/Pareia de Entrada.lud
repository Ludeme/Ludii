        (description "Pareia de Entrada is a race game from medieval Spain that is related to other European Tables games. It is one of the earliest forms of Tables that employs a second turn when doubles are rolled on the dice.")
        (rules "2x12 board, divided in half. Spaces on each side take the form of semi-circular sockets, into which the pieces fit. Fifteen pieces per player. Two or three dice. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the value on one die then another piece the value on the other die, or by moving one piece the value of one die and then the value of the other. Both players enter their pieces into the same quadrant of the board, and move pieces along a horseshoe-shaped track around the board toward the quadrant on the opposite side of the board.  When a piece lands on a space occupied by a single piece of the opponent, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and must enter again as before. When all of the dice present the same number, the player receives another turn. The player to bear off all of their pieces first wins.
