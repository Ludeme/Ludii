Fifteen pieces per player, which begin on the rightmost point, with respect to the player, on the opposite side of the board from which they sit. Two six-sided dice. Pieces move according to the throws of the dice, the value of a die being used to move a piece the entire value of the die. A throw of double sixes makes the player play six twice, then five twice, then four twice, and so on down to one. A throw of double fives forces the player to play five twice and then six twice. A throw of double four, three, or two forces the player to play two of that number, down to one. A play of double ones forces the player to play one twice, then two twice, up to six. More than two pieces of the same player may not occupy a point on the starting side of the board. The player cannot move past the penultimate point on the opposite side of the board until five pieces have been moved from the starting point. A single opponent's piece may be removed from the board when a player's piece lands on it, and the opponent's piece must reenter the board. Pieces cannot move to a point occupied by two opponent's piece. A piece cannot reenter the board on a point occupied by another piece, whether belonging to the player or the opponent. When all of a player's pieces have reached the final quadrant of the board, the player may begin to remove them from the table. The player who bears off their pieces scores two points.")
