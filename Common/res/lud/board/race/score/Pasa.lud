(description "Pasa is a dice game that was played in the Andes since at least the eighteenth century. It involves a special seven-sided die, and includes rolls where players may lose points. The highest roll is called \"Huayru,\" which is a word for dice known to be used by the Inka.")
(rules "The board is a double-headed eagle, with two lines of ten holes. One seven-sided die. One side has a special mark, one is blank, and the others are numbered 1-5. The special mark scores 10, the blank side scores -10. Players roll the die, and add up their scores as they go, placing a peg in a hole to mark ten points. The player who reaches 100 points first wins.")
