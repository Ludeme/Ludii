        (description "Momentum is a tactical abstract board game for two players in which the lead swings back and forth like the spheres of Newton’s cradle. The mechanics of the game simulate the game of marbles. Momentum is normally played on a 7 x 7 game board but can be played on game boards of various sizes and shapes and with more players.")
        (rules "Players take turns dropping one of their marbles onto the game board. The momentum of the dropped marble is transferred in up to eight directions through adjacent contiguous lines of marbles. The last marble at the end of each of these lines is pushed away one cell from the dropped marble. Some marbles may fall off the board. 
            
        The first player to have a predetermined number (8 is standard game) of his or her marbles on the board at the end of his or her turn wins the game. Options for different boards and player counts are selectable and can be viewed on the Rules tab.")
