Three sticks, round on one side and flat on the other, used as dice. The throws are as follows: three round sides = 10; three flat sides up = 5; one round and two flat = 3; two round and one flat = 1 or 2. Players move from one of the wider spaces around the board in opposite directions. When a player lands on the same spot as the opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is sent back to the beginning. The first player to complete a circuit of the board wins.
