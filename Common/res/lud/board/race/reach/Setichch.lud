Four or six players, played on two teams, with two sticks per team, starting in one of the gaps. Three sticks, round on one side and flat on the other, used as dice. The throws are as follows: three round sides = 10; two round sides = 2; one round side = 3; three flat sides = 5. A throw of 10 grants the player another throw. Pieces move according to the throws in opposite directions around the board. The team to get their pieces to the starting gap wins.")
