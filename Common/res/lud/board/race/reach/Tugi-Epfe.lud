Three sticks used as dice, one side flat, the other round. One of the sticks is notched on the round side. Throws are as follows: All flat sides up = 5; all round sides up = 10; one flat and two round, with no notches up = 1, two flat and one round, with no notches up = 3, two flat or two round, with notches up = 15. Pieces begin in one corner of the board. Players may move in opposite directions around the board, or in the same direction. When players move in the same direction, they may send the opponent's piece back to the beginning if they land on their spot. When the opponent is sent back to the beginning, they may then choose their direction of play. When players are moving in opposite directions, the opponent's piece may not be sent to start. The first player to travel around the board and land in the starting space wins.")
