When the final counter of a sowing lands in an occupied hole, the contents are picked up and sowing continues. When the final counter lands in an empty hole in the player's inner row, the contents of the opponent's hole in the inner row opposite it are captured, and if there are counters also in the corresponding outer row hole, these are also captured. The player may also capture from another hole from the opponent's side of the board of their choosing. The turn ends. If the final counter lands in an empty hole in the player's outer row, the turn ends. Play continues until one player captures all of the opponent's counters, thus winning.")
