If the last counter falls into an occupied hole, they pick the counters in this hole up and continue sowing. Sowing ends when the last counter falls into an empty hole. If the empty hole is in the inner row, the player captures any of the counters in the opponent's two holes opposite it. Play ends when all of one player's seeds have been captured.")
