Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction, only into an empty hole. When a counter lands in a hole in the inner row and the opponent's opposite inner row hole is empty, the contents of the opponent's opposite outer row hole are captured. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
