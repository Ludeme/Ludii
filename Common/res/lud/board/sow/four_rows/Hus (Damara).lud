Play begins with two counters in the outer row of each players' holes and two counter in each of the four holes on the right hand side of both players' inner row of holes. Player picks up contents of any hole containing two or more counters and sows them anti-clockwise. If the final counter of the sowing falls into an empty hole, the turn is over. If the last counter falls into an occupied hole, sowing continues by picking up the counters in that hole and continuing in the same direction. If the last counter falls into an occupied hole in the player's inner row, and the opponent's two holes opposite it are occupied, these are captured and sowing continues using these counters beginning at the next hole after the one which caused the capture. Play ends when one player cannot move; i.e. when they have only single counters in holes or all their counters have been captured."))
