When the final counter lands in a hole in the opponent's row containing one or two counters, thus making it contain two or three counters, they are captured. Any other holes in the opponent's row which also contain two or three counters, in an unbroken sequence preceding the hole where the first capture was made, are captured. When a player sows around the board, the hole from which the coutners were taken is left empty. Play ends when one player cannot play from their row, and players capture any remaining counters in their holes. The player with the most counters wins."))
