        (rules "2x8 board. Four counters in each hole. Play begins with both players placing all of the counters in the rightmost three holes in their row into the rightmost hole. Counters are sown in an anti-clockwise fashion, but they can be sown clockwise only if it leads to a capture. Counters are captured when the final counter is sown into a hole opposite a hole containing one or three counters, and those are take. If the hole opposite the next hole also contains one or three, these are also taken, continuing until a hole with any other number of counters is reached. Instead of taking counters from one of their holes, a player may sow any or all of the counters they have captured, beginning from the leftmost hole. The same rules for sowing apply. The game ends when one player has no counters in their holes.")
