When the final counter falls into an occupied hole, the contents of that hole are picked up and sowing continues. If the final counter falls into a hole containing one or three counters, the player captures those counters, plus any counters in the hole in the opposite row, as well as the contents of any holes in an unbroken sequence following the one in which the final counter which also contain two or four counters.When the final counter falls into an empty hole, the turn ends. Play continues until all of the pieces are captured. The player who captured the most counters wins.")
