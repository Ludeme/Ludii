Sowing can occur in the following directions: From the leftmost hole, clockwise; from the rightmost hole, anti-clockwise; from the center hole, the player may choose either direction. If the final counter falls into a hole in the opponent's row containing one counter, making it now contain two, these are taken. If the holes before them also contain two, in an unbroken sequence, they may all be captured. Single counters cannot be sown. When neither player can move, the single counters in each player's rows are taken by the player belonging to those rows. The player with the most counters wins.")
