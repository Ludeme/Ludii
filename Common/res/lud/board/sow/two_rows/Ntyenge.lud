        (rules "2x8 board. Four counters per hole. Players alternate turns taking the counters from one of the holes in their row and sowing them in an anticlockwise direction. When the final counter falls into a hole containing one or three counters, causing it to contain two or four, these counters are captured. Play continues until all of the counters have been captured. The player who captured the most counters wins.")
