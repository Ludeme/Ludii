        (rules "2x6 board with two stores. Four counters in each hole. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter lands in a hole containing one or two counters, thus making it contain two or three counters, these are captured. When this capture is made, other holes with two or three counters in them, in an uninterrupted sequence behind the hole from which the first capture was made, are captured. The player who captures the most counters wins.")
