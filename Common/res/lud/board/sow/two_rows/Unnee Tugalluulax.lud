The game is imbued with the symbolism of the cycle of reproduction of a cow, as a hole fills with counters it progresses along the cycle of reproduction until it has four counters, when the calve is produced and the four counters are captured.")

If the final counter lands in a hole in the player's row containing three counters, four with the addition of the final counter, these are captured. Play continues until one player cannot move or the board position repeats. When one player cannot move, the other player captures the remaining counters. The player with the most counters wins."))
