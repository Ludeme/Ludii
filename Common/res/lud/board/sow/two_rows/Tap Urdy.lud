        (description "Tap Urdy is a two-row mancala-style board game played in Turkmenistan during the early twentieth century. The game is played in holes dug into the ground, and the counters are typically sheep droppings.")
        (rules "2x6 board. Four counters in each hole. Players sow counters in a clockwise directions from one of the holes in their opponent's row. When the final counter lands in an occupied hole, the contents of that hole are picked up and sowing continues, unless the next hole is empty, in which case the contents of the next hole after the empty hole are captured. When the final counter falls in an empty hole, the turn ends. Play continues until all of the holes are empty in one of the rows. The player who captured the most counters wins.")
