        (aliases {"Rio Kadashi"})
        (rules "2x6 board. Four counters per hole. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter of a sowing lands in an occupied hole, these counters are picked up and the sowing continues. During sowing, the contents of any hole made to contain four counters are captured by the player in whose row the hole is located, except when this is the final counter of a sowing, in which case the player who is sowing captures these counters. When the sowing ends in an empty hole, the turn ends. Play continues until one player cannot move, and the other player captures the remaining counters. A second round is played, each player placing four counters into each hole starting from the rightmost hole in their row. The player with more counters gains a hole from their opponent for every four extra balls they've captured. If an opponent has three extra after counting in such a way, they also gain a hole, but not if there are one or two extra. Play continues in several rounds like this until one player captures all the holes.")
