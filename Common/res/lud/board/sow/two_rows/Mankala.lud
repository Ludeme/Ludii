When the final counter of a sowing lands in a hole, making it contain two, four, or six counters,  these counters are taken. If the second to last hole also contains two, four, or six counters, these are also taken, continuing in an unbroken line until a hole with containing a number of counters other than two, four, or six. The game continues until all of the counters have been captured. The player who captured the most counters wins.")
