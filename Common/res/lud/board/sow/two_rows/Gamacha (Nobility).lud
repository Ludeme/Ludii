        (rules "2x6 board. Four counters in each hole. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter of a sowing lands in an empty hole on the player's own row, the contents of the opponent's opposite hole are captured only if it contains one counter. If the final counter lands in an occupied hole, the contents of it are picked up and sowing continues. If the final counter lands in a hole in the opponent's row, causing it to contain four counters, the hole becomes a qasamo, and it can no longer be sown from. Play continues until all of the counters are captured or are in a qasamo. The player with the most counters captured and in all qasamo belonging to them wins.")
