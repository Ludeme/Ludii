A player picks up all of the counters in one of the holes on their side, depositing one in each consecutive hole in a counterclockwise manner. If the last counter is placed in a hole with one less than the original starting number of counters (thus making the number of counters equal to the starting number), the player \"makes a fish\" (Ã¡ra ot-tjin) and captures the pieces in that hole. Sowing cannot begin from.a hole containing a single counter. Play continues until one player cannot play, at which point their opponent captures the remaining counters on the board. The player with the most captured counters wins. If both players have only single counters in their holes, they must play again."))
