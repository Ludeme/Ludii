        (description "Intotoi is a two-row mancala-style board game played by the Samburu people of Kenya. It was documented in the early twentieth century.")
        (rules "2x12 board. Starting position, from the left hand hole, for each player: 0-3-3-0-3-3-0-3-3-0-3-3 In the opening play, one player must sow two counters from the second hole from their right. The opponent then makes the same play from their row, or from the fourth hole from their right. When the final counter lands in an occupied hole, these are picked up and sowing continues. A player's turn ends when the final counter falls into an empty hole. Players may now begin their move from any hole in their row, but only if it ends in an empty hole in their row or if it enters the opponent's row. If the final counter lands in an occupied hole in the opponent's row, these are picked up and sowing continues. If the final counter lands in an occupied hole in the player's row, the contents of the hole in the opponent's hole opposite it are captured. Sowing ends when a capture is made or when a counter falls into an empty hole.")
