        (rules "Two rows of four piles. Six counters in each pile. A player picks up the counters in one of her piles and sows them anti-clockwise, beginning in the place from which the pile originated. Any piles containing 2, 4, or 6 counters at the end of sowing are captured. Play continues until all of the counters have been captured. The player who captures the most counters wins.")
