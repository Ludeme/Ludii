Counters are captured when the final counter of a sowing is dropped into a hole in the opponent's row containing one or two counters, making it contain two or three counters. If the previous hole also contains two or three counters, they are also captured, in an unbroken line until a hole with a different number of counters is reached. If, while sowing, the hole from which the sowing originated is reached, this hole is skipped and sowing continues. If a player has no counters in their holes, the opponent must play so as to place counters in their row. The player who captures 25 coutners first wins.")
