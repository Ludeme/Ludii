        (rules "2x6 board. Three counters in each hole. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter falls into an occupied hole, the player picks up the counters in the next hole and continues sowing from it. If that next hole is empty, the turn ends. If the final counter falls into an empty hole, the contents of the following hole are captured. Play continues until one player can no longer play because there are no counters left on their side. The opponent then takes the remainder of the counters on the board. For the next round, each player counts out the counters they captured, placing three each of the holes in their row. For every three in excess of the amount required to fill all of the holes in a row, the player claims one hole from the opponent's row. Play continues in this fashion until one player captures all of the holes on the board.")
