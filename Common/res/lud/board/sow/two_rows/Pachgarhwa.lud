When the final counters of a sowing lands in a hole, the contents of the next hole are picked up and sowing continues. When the final counter lands in a hole, and the next hole, from which sowing would normally continue, is empty, the player captures any counters in the next hole after the empty one. and the turn ends. Play continues until no more captures are possible, and the player who captured the most counters wins.")
