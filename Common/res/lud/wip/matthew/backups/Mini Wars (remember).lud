            //------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            <b>General Rules:</b>

            <u>The following rules apply to all units, unless stated otherwise in their description:</u>

            - All units move and measure distance orthogonally.
            - Units may move up to their maximum movement limit and can then attack an adjacent site.

            - Attacking a unit will deal damage to it (see damage calculation section).
            - If an attacked unit's health reaches zero, it will be removed from the battlefield.
            - Defending units that survive an attack, will then deal counter damage to their attacker.

            <u>The following rules apply to all buildings:</u>

            - There are five types of building: Town, Factory, Airport, Dock and Base.

            - Attacking a building will deal damage to it (see damage calculation section).
            - If an attacked building's health reaches zero, it will change ownership to the player who attacked it and receive 50 health.
            - Buildings that are attacked, will not deal counter damage.

            - Units can heal at an adjacent building, instead of attacking.
            - Healing at a building, will convert health from the building to the unit, transferring as much health as possible.

            - Additional units can be purchased using gold at their corresponding production building.
            - To purchase a unit, drag it from your hand to an available site next to a production building.
            - Each player's gold is represented by their score.
            - The cost of purchasing a unit is represented by its count.
            - Purchased units cannot move, attack or heal on the same turn they are purchased.

            - A player can only use a building (to produce or heal units) if they own it.
            - Each player receives one gold for every Town they own, at the start of their turn.
            - Buildings gain 10 health at the start of the owning player's turn, up to a maximum of 100.
            - Grey buildings are neutral, and are not owned by any player.

            - If a player loses ownership of all their Bases, they lose the game.

            //------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            <b>Movement Restrictions:</b>

            Humans may travel across plains, forests, and shallow water.
            Vehicles may travel across plains. They may also move 1 space into forests instead of their regular movement.
            Aircraft may travel across all spaces.
            Boats may travel across shallow and deep water.
            Buildings cannot move (obviously).
            Units cannot move over enemy or neutral occupied spaces.

            //------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            <b>Damage Calculation:</b>

            An attacking unit deals damage equal to its health, multiplied by its damage factor.
            For example, A submarine has a damage factor of 80%, so a submarine with 20 health will deal 16 damage when it attacks (20 x 0.8).
            If the defending unit is in shallow or deep water, it takes 25% more damage.
            If the defending unit is in a forest, it takes 25% less damage.
            Aircraft are unaffected by terrain when calculating damage against them.
            All damage values are rounded down to the nearest whole number.

            //------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            <b>Army Doctrine:</b>
