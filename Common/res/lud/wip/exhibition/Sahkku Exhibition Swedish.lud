Delarna rör sig diagonalt mot den motsatta sidan av brädet. Pjäser fångas genom att hoppa över en motståndares pjäs. De kan fånga flera bitar i en sekvens och måste fånga om möjligt. En pjäs befordras när den når motsatt sida av brädet, då kan den flyttas framåt eller bakåt över vilken sträcka som helst. Spelaren som erövrar alla sina motståndares pjäser vinner.")
