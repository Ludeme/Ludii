        (rules "4x6 board. Six counters in each hole. Players sow counters from a hole on their side of the board. When the final counter of a sowing lands in an empty hole, the contents of the opponent's opposite holes are captured, and then sowing continues with these counters. When the final counter of a sowing lands in an occupied hole, the turn ends. When one player has captured all of the opponent's counters, or the opponent has only a single counter remaining, the player wins.")
