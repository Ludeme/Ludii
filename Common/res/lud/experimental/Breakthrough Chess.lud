(description "A variant of Breakthrough played with Chess pieces and rules (mostly).")
(rules "Chess-Breakthrough is played using a regular chess board and pieces and from the standard chess start position. The first player to place a pawn or a knight on the opponent’s backrank wins (thus no promotions). The normal chess rules for piece movements have also been slightly modified to fit our simplified boardgame framework: castling, en-passant, and two-step pawn moves are not allowed; a king can be moved into and left in check (and thus captured); and the draw-by-threefold-repetition and 50-move rules do not apply.")
