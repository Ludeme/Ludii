        (rules "Played on an 8x8 board with one player starting with two rows of counters on one end of the board, and the opponent starting with two rows of counters on the opposite end of the board. Pieces can move by orthogonally or diagonally hopping over any single adjacent piece into an empty cell. There is no capture of pieces in this game. The first player to reach the opponent's edge of the board wins.")
