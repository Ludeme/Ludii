            The objective of the second player (called codebreaker) is to try to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within a specific number of tries (corresponding to the number of rows). Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the board.
        Once placed, a feedback on his last try is provided by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess. A black key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.")
