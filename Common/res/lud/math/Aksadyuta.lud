While the Mahabharata was an oral tradition which was written down much later, one of its key events is a game of Akṣadyūta in which Shakuni won the kingdom from Yudhishthira. Later Indian sources often confuse the game as that of Pachisi or Chaupar, but the text clearly describes a game of a different nature.")
