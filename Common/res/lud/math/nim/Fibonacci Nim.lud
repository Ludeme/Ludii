        (rules "Fibonacci Nim is played by two players, who alternate removing coins or other counters from a pile. On the first move, a player is not allowed to take all of the coins, and on each subsequent move, the number of coins removed can be any number that is at most twice the previous move. According to the normal play convention, the player who takes the last coin wins. Or according to the Mis√®re game, the player who takes the last coin loses.")
