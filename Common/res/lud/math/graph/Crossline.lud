        (rules "Players begin by drawing a circle with ten dots evenly spaced around it (the spacing can be approximate). The first player starts by drawing a straight line connecting any two dots that are not adjacent. After that, each player in turns draws a straight line that connects any two dots and that crosses exactly one (and only one) previously drawn line. The player who draws the last legal line is the winner.")
