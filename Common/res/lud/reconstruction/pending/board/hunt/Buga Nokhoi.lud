(description "Buga Nokhoi is a hunt game played in Mongolia. It is thought to either reflect a deer hunt, or may reflect the symbolic nature of deer the deer, which are not captured as one would expect in a hunt.")
(rules "5x5 intersecting lines, with diagonals in each 3x3 quadrant of the board. On opposite sides, a square with diagonals, with one corner as the midpoint of one of the sides of the main board. One player plays as two deer, which begin on the points where the small squares intersect with the main board. The other player plays with twelve dogs, at least some of which begin in the main part of the board, but some may be introduced later. Pieces move to an adjacent empty spot along the lines of the board. The deer may capture an adjacent dog by hopping over it to an empty space immediately on the opposite side of it along the lines of the board. The goal of the deer is to capture all of the dogs, the goal of the dogs is to block the deer from being able to move.")
