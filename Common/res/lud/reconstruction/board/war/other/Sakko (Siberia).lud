One piece, the king, is set in the center of the board, and belongs to neither player at the beginning of the game. Three six-sided dice, marked on one side with a cross (Sakko), 1, 2, 3, 4, and blank. Rolling a Sakko allows the player to move one of their pieces from their starting position. Pieces move to one side of the board, and then to the central lime. When a piece lands on a piece belonging to the opponent, the opponent's piece is captured. When a player's piece lands on the King, they take possession of the King. The King may move in any direction along the lines of the board. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.
