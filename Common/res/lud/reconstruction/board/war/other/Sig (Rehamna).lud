        (rules "4x12 board. Twelve pieces per player, arranged on the outer rows of the board. Six sticks, round on one side and flat on the other, used as dice. Throw of one single side and five of the other side = 1. A throw of 1 is required for each piece's first move. Players may capture their opponent's pieces. Players win after capturing opponent's pieces and moving their own pieces into the opponent's row.")
