        (rules "12x12 squares on the board, played on the intersections of the lines, except those on the edge. The central intersection holds a bowl where the dice are rolled. Three dice. One player plays as black, the other as white, sixty pieces per player. Pieces begin on the board. White pieces are placed in two 7x7x7 triangles in opposite corners, along with the four spaces orthogonally adjacent to the dice bowl. The black pieces begin on the remaining spaces. Players remove pieces according to the throws of their dice. ")
