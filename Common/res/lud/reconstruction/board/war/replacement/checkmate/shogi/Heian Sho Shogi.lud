        (rules "8x8 or 8x9 board. Pieces are as follows: Osho (king): Moves in every direction; Ginsho (gold general): does not move left, right, or backward; Keima (knight): moves orthogonally one square and then diagonally another square; Kosha (lance)moves forward any distance; Fuhyo (soldier) moves one square. If the Fuhyo enters the third rank on the opponent's side of the board, they are promoted to Ginsho. A player wins when the opponent is reduced to the Osho and one Ginsho.")
