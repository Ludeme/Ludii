The king begins on the central spot of one of the short rows of the board, flanked by two scholars, which are flanked by two horses. The cauldrons are in front of the horses, and the pawns are one square in front of all the pieces. The cauldron moves any number of spaces orthogonally. The scholars move as queens (either one space diagonally or any number of spaces diagonally or orthogonally).  The king cannot be in check. ")
