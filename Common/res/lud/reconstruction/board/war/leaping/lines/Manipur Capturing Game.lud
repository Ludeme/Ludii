        (rules "5x5 intersecting lines, with the two diagonals of the full board. The player's pieces begin on opposite sides of the board. Players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent spot along the lines of the board. A piece may capture an opponent's piece by hopping over it to an empty adjacent spot immediately on the opposite side of the piece along the lines of the board. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins. Pieces are not promoted when reaching the opposite side of the board from where they begin.")
