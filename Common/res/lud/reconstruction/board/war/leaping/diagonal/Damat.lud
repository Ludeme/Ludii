        (rules "12x12 checkered board. 30 pieces per player. Played on the black squares. Pieces move forward diagonally one space. Pieces capture an adjacent opponent's piece by hopping over it to an empty space immediately on the opposite side of it. When a piece reaches the opposite edge of the board from where it started, it is promoted. Promoted pieces may move any distance in a diagonal line as long as there is an empty space at the end of the jump.")
