One player plays as three tigers (laargeer pieces), while the other plays as eleven or twelve smaller pieces. The tigers may hop over a smaller piece to capture it. The goal of the tigers is to capture the little pieces, the goal of the little pieces is to block the tigers from being able to move.")
