        (rules "Played on the Fox and Geese board, the topmost square of which is the fortress, in which one player puts two defenders. The opponent has thirteeen pieces, which occupy the points of the bottommost square and the bottom of the horizontal arm of the board. Defenders may capture one of the opponent's pieces by hopping over it to an empty space immediately on the opposite side of the opponent's piece. The soldiers win by occupying all of the points in the fortress or by blocking the officers from being able to move; the officers win by capturing enough soldiers to prevent this.
