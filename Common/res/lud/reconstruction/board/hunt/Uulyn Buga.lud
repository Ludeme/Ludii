On opposite sides, a square with diagonals, with one corner as the midpoint of one of the sides of the main board. One player plays as two deer, which begin in the smaller squares. The other player plays with twenty or 22 children, half of which begin in the main part of the board. Pieces move to an adjacent empty spot along the lines of the board. The player playing as the children may place one of their remaining pieces onto the board on their turn, on an empty spot. The deer may capture an adjacent dog by hopping over it to an empty space immediately on the opposite side of it along the lines of the board. the goal of the deer is to capture all of the dogs, the goal of the dogs is to block the deer from being able to move.
