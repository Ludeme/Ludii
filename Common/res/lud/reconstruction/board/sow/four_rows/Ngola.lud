        (rules "4x8 board. Two counters in each hole. Players alternate turns sowing from a hole in their row in an anti-clockwise direction. When the last counter falls in a hole in the player's inner row, the contents of the opponent's two holes opposite are captured, and sowing continues with these counters. Play continues until one player has no holes with more than one counter, and the opponent wins.")
