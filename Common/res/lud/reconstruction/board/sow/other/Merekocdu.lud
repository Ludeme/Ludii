        (aliases {"Mereköçdü"})
        (rules "Two or four players. Three holes per player, arranged in a circle. Seven counters per hole. When players sow, the first counter is sown into the hole from which the counters were taken. When the final counter falls into a hole, making it contain two or four counters, the counters are captured. Play continues until all the counters are captured. A new round begins. Any player which captured more than seven counters in excess of their original 21 captures a hole from their opponent. Play continues as before. A player wins when their opponent is unable to fill a hole with seven counters.")
