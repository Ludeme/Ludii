From the central hole of this vertical line (counting the central hole of the bottom line), a square with eleven holes per side. Extending to the left and right of this, five more squares on each side. Five squares extend upwards diagonally from the end of each of these lines, joining at an apex. Intersecting with the fifth square in the initial vertical line, a square with eleven spaces per side. Every fifth square is marked with an X. Players enter from opposite ends of the bottom horizontal track. ")
