Immediately above this, another square, with its left side aligned with the left side of the other square, but with smaller squares (thus, the squares do not line up where they are adjacent. The outer squares of the bottom track are marked, as are every fifth space from them along the board, except in the smaller square which is marked in all but the bottom left corner with a single diagonal..
