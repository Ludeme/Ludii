(description "Tawfa is a game that was played by the Hualapai people in the nineteenth century. While it was said to be going out of fashion at the time, it may have a very long history, as similar boards have been found from 2900 BCE in Mexico.")
(rules "Fifty stones, arranged in two-thirds of a circle, with 25 on either side of a larger stone at the apex of this arc. These smaller stones are the counters. Another large stone in the center, on which three sticks, used as dice, are thrown. These sticks are flat on one side, round on the other. The throws are as follows: one flat side up = 1; two flat sides up =3; three flat sides up = 5; three round sides up = 10. Players move stones according to the throws. The first player to reach the large stone first wins.")
