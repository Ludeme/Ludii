        (description "Edris a Jin was a game played by the Druze people of Lebanon during the nineteenth century. It was played on a cruciform board, with diagonals connecting the arms of the cross, resulting in an octagonal board.")
        (rules "Four 4x8 rectangles, arranged in a cross. The central space is divided into a 4x4 grid. The corners of the arms of the cross are connected by diagonal tracks of eight squares, forming a diagonal board. Four cowries, used as dice. Three pieces per player, one of which is the \"chief,\" the other two are \"soldiers.\" ")
