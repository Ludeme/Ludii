        (description "This game was found in a Predynastic tomb at El-Mahasna in Egypt. There is some discussion of whether it could be an offering table instead of a game, but it echoes later Senet board from Egypt, though it has a 3x6 pattern instead of a 3x10.")
        (rules "3x6 board. Two players, ten smaller pieces and two larger pieces.")
