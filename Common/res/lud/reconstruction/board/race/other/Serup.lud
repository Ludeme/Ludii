(description "Serup is a game played by the Diegueño people of California. The rules were not recorded, but it is played with stick dice and on a board similar to other games played in the southwest United States and Mexico.")
(rules "Four stick dice, each of which is marked differently. The board is rendered as a series of holes. They are in the form of a trapezoid: 11 holes on the bottom side, and ten in the remaining four. From the left of the bottom side and the right of the top side are four extra holes extending out.")
