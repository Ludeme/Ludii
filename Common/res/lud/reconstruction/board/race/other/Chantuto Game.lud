        (description "This game was found at the Tlacuachero shell mound in Chiapas, Mexico. Dating to the Late Archaic Period (3500-1500 BCE), it was identified as a game based on similarities to other games known from ethnographic accounts in North America. It is the oldest potential game board known in the Western Hemisphere.")
