        (rules "Two concentric circles, with four radii from the outer circle to in the center, dividing the circles into four equal parts. There are four arcs, each of which bisects a radius between where each radius intersects the circumference of each circle, the arc also intersecting with the outer circle's circumference. One player plays as a bear, which begins on the central point, the other as three hunters, which begin on any three points on the inner circle.")
