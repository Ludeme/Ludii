There are four arcs, each of which bisects a radius between where each radius intersects the circumference of each circle, the arc also intersecting with the outer circle's circumference. One player plays as a hare the other as three dogs. The players alternate turns moving one of their pieces along the lines of the board. If the dogs block the hare from being able to move, the dogs win. ")
