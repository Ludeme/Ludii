When all the pieces are placed, players alternate turns moving a piece to an empty adjacent spot along the lines of the board. When three of a player's pieces form a line, the player removes one of the opponent's pieces. Pieces which are in a line of three cannot be removed. The player who removes all of the opponent's pieces wins.
