One player plays as two deer, one of which which begins on a point in the small square intersecting with the main board, the other in the triangle. The other player plays with 22, 24, or 26 hunters, half of which begin in the main part of the board. Pieces move to an adjacent empty spot along the lines of the board. The deer may capture an adjacent dog by hopping over it to an empty space immediately on the opposite side of it along the lines of the board. The player playing as the hunters may place a remaining piece on an empty spot on the board as their turn.
