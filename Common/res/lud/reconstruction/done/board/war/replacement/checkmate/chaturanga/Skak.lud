The pieces move as follows, with the number per player: 1 x King: moves one space orthogonally or diagonally. 1 x Queen: moves any distance diagonally or orthogonally. 2 x Rook: Any number of spaces orthogonally. 2 x Bishop: moves any distance diagonally 2 x Knight: Moves as a chess knight. 8 x Pawn: Moves one space forward orthogonally; one space forward diagonally to capture. Promoted when reaching the eighth rank. Castling and en passant are allowed. An opponent's piece is captured by moving a player's own piece onto a space occupied by the opponent's piece. When a King can be captured on the next turn by an opponent's piece, it is in check. The King must not be in check at the end of the player's turn. If this is not possible, it is checkmate and the opponent wins. Stalemate is a draw. When a player captures all of their opponent's pieces except the King are captured, the opponent loses, though this is considered a lesser win.
