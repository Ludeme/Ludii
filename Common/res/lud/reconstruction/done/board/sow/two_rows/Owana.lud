     Select Vertex in RegionP1 or RegionP2 if the total number of vertex in the location of the piece is greater than 1 then Sow with the following rules, startLoc: the to location of the last move, countFn: the total number of vertex in the to location of the last move, numPerHoleFn: 1, origin: false, captureRule: true, captureEffect: if 2 is equal to the total number of vertex in to or 3 is equal to the total number of vertex in to, from vertex in to to vertex Player the moving player's hand site 0 moveRule: true and if to is not equal to  the Vertex 1 steps ahead of to in the direction east, if 2 is equal to the total number of vertex in  the Vertex 1 steps ahead of to in the direction east or 3 is equal to the total number of vertex in  the Vertex 1 steps ahead of to in the direction east, from vertex in  the Vertex 1 steps ahead of to in the direction east to vertex Player the moving player's hand site 0 moveRule: true and if to is not equal to  the Vertex 1 steps ahead of to in the direction west, if 2 is equal to the total number of vertex in  the Vertex 1 steps ahead of to in the direction west or 3 is equal to the total number of vertex in  the Vertex 1 steps ahead of to in the direction west, from vertex in  the Vertex 1 steps ahead of to in the direction west to vertex Player the moving player's hand site 0 moveRule: true, type: Vertex, includeSelf: true.
Aim: 
     If all sites in [1,2,3,4] satisfy the condition 0 is equal to the total number of vertex in current site, player two wins If all sites in [5,6,7,8] satisfy the condition 0 is equal to the total number of vertex in current site, player one wins.
