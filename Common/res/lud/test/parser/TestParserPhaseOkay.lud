        (rules "Eight spots arranged in a circle around a central spot. Opposite spots are connected by a diameter through the central spot.")
        (rules "Three pieces per player. Players take turns placing their pieces on a spot where the lines intersect. They then take turns moving one piece to an adjacent empty spot. The first player to place three pieces in a row wins the game. ")
