        (description "Squava D2 is an experimental game to test the detection of randomness versus skill. Winning and losing moves only have a 50% chance of succeeding.")
        (rules "Two players take turns adding a piece to an empty cell. If the mover makes a line of exactly 3 of their colour (orthogonally or diagonally) then they must roll a D2 and lose immediately if they roll a 1. If the mover makes a line of 4 or more of their colour then they must roll a D2 and win immediately if they roll a 2. The game is drawn if the board fills up without a result.")
