        (description "Ultimately originates from Indian Chaturanga, arrived in Western Europe during the Middle Ages as Shatranj. Over several centuries, after seeming experimentation with movement, the adoption of the modern movement of the queen and bishop made chess what it is today. Modern Chess appeared sometimes during the fourteenth or fifteenth Century, when the vizier piece was replaced by the queen. It since has become perhaps the most popular game in the world, with massive international competitions.")

Players capture pieces by moving onto a space occupied by an opponent's piece. Player wins when they capture the other player's king.")
