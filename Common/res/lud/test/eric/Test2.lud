        (description "Squish Implementation notes:
            
            I have implemented your games Squish and Advanced Squish.
            
            In the corrected version a singleton is not a group, and so can move without joining a group.
            
            I also added a combo version with step to merge moves and restricted slide to capture.
            
            I then added some variants as I thought of them:
            -- Simple Squish, a pure race version, that still has surprising complexity. This is so simple I suspect someone has done it before? It is a bit like where Muster was headed before I added a placement phase.
            
            -- a LOS version that shows how I first misunderstood your rules.
            
            I then realised that in advanced Squish, the goal of unifying your pieces means you are not able to move afterwards, so:
            -- Advanced Misere Squish in which the goal is purely to stalemate yourself.
            
            -- Sliding Squish is a version for the advanced game (It seemed too quick and powerful a mechanism for the standard Squish.)
            
            -- Shakattrition, a misere version with sliding which reminded me of my Shaka and Infuse, since when the Squish rule is combine with sliding, the end-game becomes line of sight; but in this case, instead of building territory to be last to play as in Shaka, one is shedding pieces for the same reason.
            
            I tried to follow your published graphics as much as Ludii allows.
            Hope you like the results."
        )
        
        (rules "Goal: Unify the pieces of your color into a single group, or prevent your opponent from moving.
            
            Setup: Pieces of each color are distributed symmetrically on every 3rd cell of the board.
            (For a game on an order 4 board, the outer cells are not used.)
            
            Play:
            Decide which player will play with which color (Dark or Light). Light is the first player to play.
            
            On each turn, the mover mmoves one piece to an adjacent cell that is one step closer to another of his pieces.
            If that cell is occupied by the opponent's piece, that piece is removed in the process of moving.
            A piece cannot move onto a cell occupied by another friendly piece.
            
            The game ends in a loss for a player who cannot move any piece; or ends in a win for a player whose pieces form a single group at the end of their own turn.
            
            Options: The Advanced version furthur restricts movement by requiring that if a piece moves to an empty cell, it must join a group that is larger than the group that it was initially part of.
            Thus an isolated piece must join a group, and a piece leaving a group must become part of a larger group, or merge two groups to form a larger group.
            
            This restriction increases the possibility of not being able to move, and may also force captures.
