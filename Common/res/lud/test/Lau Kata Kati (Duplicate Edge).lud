        (rules "Play begins with each player's pieces on the pieces occupying the points of one of the triangles, leaving the shared apex empty. Pieces move to the next adjacent point connected by a line. Captures are made by hopping over an opponent's piece. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
