(aliases {"Block Dominoes" "the Block Game" "Allies"})
(rules "At the beginning of the game, each player has 7 dominoes. The goal of the game is to use all the dominoes on his hand. A Domino can be played only if it can be placed in the line of play. If this is not possible, the player has to take another domino from the remaining dominoes and add it to his hand until he is able to place one. If the two players can not play, this is a draw.")
