        (rules "Monty Hall asks to choose one of three doors. One of the doors hides a car and the other two doors have a goat. You select which door you pick, but you donâ€™t open it right away.

            The game opens one of the other two doors, and there is no prize behind it.

        At this moment, there are two closed doors. You can keep the same choice or selecting the other door. If you get the car you win if not you loss.")
