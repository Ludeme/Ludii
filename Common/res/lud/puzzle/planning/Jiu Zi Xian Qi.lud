        (rules "The board begins initially with one stone on each playable site. First, according to the player's wish, one stone must be removed. Then, each piece jumps over another piece to an empty site to remove the piece that was jumped over. If the player has no move, they lose. If only one stone is left on the board, the player wins. A win is considered to be good luck and anything you pray for will come true.")
