// Defines a sequence of hop move in all the adjacent directions over an enemy to an empty site. 
// The enemy pieces are removed.
// #1 = Maximum distance before the hop [0].
// #2 = Maximum distance after the hop [0].
// #3 = When to perform the capture (immediately or at the end of the turn) [immediately].
// #4 = Moves to perform when the sequence cannot continue.
// @example ("HopSequenceCapture")
// @example ("HopSequenceCapture" before:(count Rows) after:(count Rows) at:EndOfTurn)
